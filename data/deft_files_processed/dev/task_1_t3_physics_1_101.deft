" They interact through forces that include the Coulomb force ."	"0"
" Action at a distance is a force between objects that are not close enough for their atoms to “ touch . ”"	"0"
" That is , they are separated by more than a few atomic diameters ."	"0"
" 2952 . Polarity of Water MoleculesThe best example of this charge screening is the water molecule , represented as H2O H2O ."	"0"
" Water is a strongly polar molecule ."	"0"
" Its 10 electrons ( 8 from the oxygen atom and 2 from the two hydrogen atoms ) tend to remain closer to the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nuclei ."	"1"
