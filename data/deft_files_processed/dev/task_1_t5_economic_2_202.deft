" A similar lesson applies to the study of macroeconomics ."	"0"
" It is interesting to study extreme situations , like the Great Depression of the 1930s or what many have called the Great Recession of 2008 â€“ 2009 ."	"0"

" 5062 . Monetary policy affects the economy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable length ."	"0"
" Remember , monetary policy involves a chain of events : the central bank must perceive a situation in the economy , hold a meeting , and make a decision to react by tightening or loosening monetary policy ."	"0"
" The change in monetary policy must percolate through the banking system , changing the quantity of loans and affecting interest rates ."	"0"
" 5074 . Most central bankers believe that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long term ."	"0"
" Remember that in the neoclassical model of the economy , the aggregate supply curve is drawn as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP , as shown in [ link ] ."	"0"
" In the neoclassical model , the level of potential GDP ( and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP ) is determined by real economic factors ."	"0"
" 5098 . [ link ] also illustrates some peculiar traits of supply and demand diagrams in the foreign exchange market ."	"0"

" 5155 . There is also no particular reason to expect a government budget to be balanced in the medium term of a few years ."	"0"
" For example , a government may decide that by running large budget deficits , it can make crucial long - term investments in human capital and physical infrastructure that will build the long - term productivity of a country ."	"0"
" These decisions may work out well or poorly , but they are not always irrational ."	"0"
" 5158 . A larger budget deficit will increase demand for financial capital ."	"0"
" If private saving and the trade balance remain the same , then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital ."	"0"
" When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital , the result is known as crowding out ."	"1"
" To understand the potential impact of crowding out , consider the situation of the U.S. economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007 ."	"0"
" 5170 . The national economies that make up the global economy are remarkably diverse ."	"0"
" Let us use one key indicator of the standard of living , GDP per capita , to quantify this diversity ."	"0"

" 5179 . For unemployment caused by a recession , the Keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available ."	"0"
" The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward : run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans , drive down interest rates , and increase aggregate demand ."	"0"
" In a recession , there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off , and so even a central bank , with fighting inflation as its top priority , can usually justify some reduction in interest rates ."	"0"
" With regard to fiscal policy , the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work , even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession ."	"0"
