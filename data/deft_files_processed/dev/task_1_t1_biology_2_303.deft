" 1101 . This arboreal heritage of primates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for brachiation , or climbing and swinging through trees ."	"1"
" These adaptations include , but are not limited to : 1 ) a rotating shoulder joint , 2 ) a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes and thumbs , which are widely separated from fingers ( except humans ) , which allow for gripping branches , 3 ) stereoscopic vision , two overlapping fields of vision from the eyes , which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance ."

" Other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of most other mammals , claws that have been modified into flattened nails , typically only one offspring per pregnancy , and a trend toward holding the body upright ."	"0"
" 1110 . Several species evolved from the evolutionary branch that includes humans , although our species is the only surviving member ."	"0"
" The term hominin is used to refer to those species that evolved after this split of the primate line , thereby designating species that are more closely related to humans than to chimpanzees ."	"1"
" Hominins were predominantly bipedal and include those groups that likely gave rise to our species — including Australopithecus , Homo habilis , and Homo erectus — and those non - ancestral groups that can be considered “ cousins ” of modern humans , such as Neanderthals ."	"0"
" 1113 . There is considerable debate about the origins of anatomically modern humans or Homo sapiens sapiens ."	"0"
