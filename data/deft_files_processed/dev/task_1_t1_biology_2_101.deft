" 309 . Both photosystems have the same basic structure ; a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place ."	"1"
" Each photosystem is serviced by the light - harvesting complex , which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center ; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of 300 – 400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids ."	"0"
" The absorption of a single photon or distinct quantity or “ packet ” of light by any of the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited state ."	"0"
" 390 . Mistakes in the duplication or distribution of the chromosomes lead to mutations that may be passed forward to every new cell produced from an abnormal cell ."	"0"
" To prevent a compromised cell from continuing to divide , there are internal control mechanisms that operate at three main cell cycle checkpoints ."	"0"
" A checkpoint is one of several points in the eukaryotic cell cycle at which the progression of a cell to the next stage in the cycle can be halted until conditions are favorable ."	"1"
" 402 . However , because there are two rounds of division , the major process and the stages are designated with a “ I ” or a “ II . ”"	"0"
" Thus , meiosis I is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase I , prometaphase I , and so on ."	"1"
" Meiosis II , in which the second round of meiotic division takes place , includes prophase II , prometaphase II , and so on ."	"1"
