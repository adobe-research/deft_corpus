" 2755 . Conservation of energy ( as physicists like to call the principle that energy can neither be created nor destroyed ) is based on experiment ."	"1"
" Even as scientists discovered new forms of energy , conservation of energy has always been found to apply ."	"0"
" 2764 . An important characteristic is that the work done by a nonconservative force adds or removes mechanical energy from a system ."	"1"
" Friction , for example , creates thermal energy that dissipates , removing energy from the system ."	"0"
" Furthermore , even if the thermal energy is retained or captured , it can not be fully converted back to work , so it is lost or not recoverable in that sense as well . The amount of the happy face erased depends on the path taken by the eraser between points A and B , as does the work done against friction ."	"0"
