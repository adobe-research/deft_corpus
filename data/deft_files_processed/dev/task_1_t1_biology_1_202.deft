" Approximately 75 percent of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are zoonotic diseases , zoonoses , diseases that primarily infect animals and are transmitted to humans ; some are of viral origin and some are of bacterial origin ."	"1"
" Brucellosis is an example of a prokaryotic zoonosis that is re - emerging in some regions , and necrotizing fasciitis ( commonly known as flesh - eating bacteria ) has been increasing in virulence for the last 80 years for unknown reasons ."	"1"

" 808 . As cell biology developed in the twentieth century , it became clear that mitochondria were the organelles responsible for producing ATP using aerobic respiration ."	"0"
" In the 1960s , American biologist Lynn Margulis developed endosymbiotic theory , which states that eukaryotes may have been a product of one cell engulfing another , one living within another , and evolving over time until the separate cells were no longer recognizable as such ."	"1"
" In 1967 , Margulis introduced new work on the theory and substantiated her findings through microbiological evidence ."	"0"
" 832 . They vary in their oxygen requirement ."	"0"
" Most fungi are obligate aerobes , requiring oxygen to survive ."	"1"
" Other species , such as the Chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle , are are obligate anaerobes , in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them ."	"1"
