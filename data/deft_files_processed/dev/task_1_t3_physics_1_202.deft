" 3252 . The division between mesons and baryons is actually based on their observed decay modes and is not strictly associated with their masses ."	"0"
" Mesons are hadrons that can decay to leptons and leave no hadrons , which implies that mesons are not conserved in number ."	"1"
" Baryons are hadrons that always decay to another baryon ."	"1"
" 3261 . What ’s Color got to do with it ?"	"0"

" As mentioned and shown in [ link ] , quarks carry another quantum number , which we call color ."	"0"
" Of course , it is not the color we sense with visible light , but its properties are analogous to those of three primary and three secondary colors ."	"0"
" 3276 . After this time , the forces become distinct in almost all interactions — they are no longer unified or symmetric ."	"0"
" This transition from GUT to electroweak is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking , in which conditions spontaneously evolved to a point where the forces were no longer unified , breaking that symmetry ."	"1"
" This is analogous to a phase transition in the universe , and a clever proposal by American physicist Alan Guth in the early 1980s ties it to the smoothness of the CMBR ."	"0"
" 3282 . It is interesting that several prominent physicists who worked on the concept , including Einstein , firmly believed that nature would find a way to prohibit such objects ."	"0"
" Black holes are difficult to observe directly , because they are small and no light comes directly from them ."	"0"
" In fact , no light comes from inside the event horizon , which is defined to be at a distance from the object at which the escape velocity is exactly the speed of light ."	"1"
" The radius of the event horizon is known as the Schwarzschild radius RS RS size 12 { R rSub { size 8 { S } } } { } and is given by"	"0"
