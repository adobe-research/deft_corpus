" 2666 . Weight ( also called force of gravity ) is a pervasive force that acts at all times and must be counteracted to keep an object from falling ."	"1"
" You definitely notice that you must support the weight of a heavy object by pushing up on it when you hold it stationary , as illustrated in [ link ] ( a ) ."	"0"

" In physics , the definition of time is simple — time is change , or the interval over which change occurs ."	"1"
" It is impossible to know that time has passed unless something changes ."	"0"
" 2735 . The property of a body to remain at rest or to remain in motion with constant velocity is called inertia ."	"1"
" Newton ’s first law is often called the law of inertia ."	"0"
" As we know from experience , some objects have more inertia than others ."	"0"
" 2891 . [ link ] shows the displacement of a harmonic oscillator for different amounts of damping ."	"0"
" When we want to damp out oscillations , such as in the suspension of a car , we may want the system to return to equilibrium as quickly as possible Critical damping is defined as the condition in which the damping of an oscillator results in it returning as quickly as possible to its equilibrium position The critically damped system may overshoot the equilibrium position , but if it does , it will do so only once ."

" Critical damping is represented by Curve A in [ link ] ."	"0"
