" Dispersal is when a few members of a species move to a new geographical area , and vicariance is when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms ."	"1"
" 645 . The other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring called an allopolyploid ."	"1"
" The prefix “ allo- ” means “ other ” ( recall from allopatric ) : therefore , an allopolyploid occurs when gametes from two different species combine ."	"0"

" In other words , all the p alleles and all the q alleles make up all of the alleles for that locus that are found in the population .

" 675 . An individual may carry a very beneficial genotype with a resulting phenotype that , for example , increases the ability to reproduce ( fecundity ) , but if that same individual also carries an allele that results in a fatal childhood disease , that fecundity phenotype will not be passed on to the next generation because the individual will not live to reach reproductive age ."

" Natural selection acts at the level of the individual ; it selects for individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next generation , known as an organism ’s evolutionary ( Darwinian ) fitness ."	"1"
" 678 . When the environment changes , populations will often undergo directional selection ( [ link ] ) , which selects for phenotypes at one end of the spectrum of existing variation ."	"1"

" That is , some males — often the bigger , stronger , or more decorated males — get the vast majority of the total matings , while others receive none ."	"0"
" 684 . In 1915 , biologist Ronald Fisher proposed another model of sexual selection : the Fisherian runaway model , which suggests that selection of certain traits is a result of sexual preference . In both the handicap principle and the good genes hypothesis , the trait is said to be an honest signal of the males ’ quality , thus giving females a way to find the fittest mates — males that will pass the best genes to their offspring ."

" 867 . After germinating from a spore , the resulting gametophyte produces both male and female gametangia , usually on the same individual ."	"0"
" In contrast , heterosporous plants produce two morphologically different types of spores ."	"1"
" The male spores are called microspores , because of their smaller size , and develop into the male gametophyte ; the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte ."	"1"
" 870 . The spores of seedless plants are surrounded by thick cell walls containing a tough polymer known as sporopollenin ."	"1"
" This complex substance is characterized by long chains of organic molecules related to fatty acids and carotenoids : hence the yellow color of most pollen ."	"0"
" 873 . The male gametangium ( antheridium ) releases sperm ."	"0"
" Many seedless plants produce sperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment to the archegonia : the female gametangium ."	"0"
" The embryo develops inside the archegonium as the sporophyte ."	"1"
" 876 . Cells in green algae divide along cell plates called phragmoplasts , and their cell walls are layered in the same manner as the cell walls of embryophytes ."	"1"
" Consequently , land plants and closely related green algae are now part of a new monophyletic group called Streptophyta ."	"1"
" 879 . The hornworts ( Anthocerotophyta ) belong to the broad bryophyte group ."	"0"
" They have colonized a variety of habitats on land , although they are never far from a source of moisture ."	"0"
" 882 . The moss lifecycle follows the pattern of alternation of generations as shown in [ link ] ."	"0"
" The most familiar structure is the haploid gametophyte , which germinates from a haploid spore and forms first a protonema — usually , a tangle of single - celled filaments that hug the ground ."	"1"
" The most familiar structure is the haploid gametophyte , which germinates from a haploid spore and forms first a protonema — usually , a tangle of single - celled filaments that hug the ground ."	"1"
" Cells akin to an apical meristem actively divide and give rise to a gametophore , consisting of a photosynthetic stem and foliage - like structures ."	"0"
" 885 . The vascular plants , or tracheophytes , are the dominant and most conspicuous group of land plants ."	"1"
" More than 260,000 species of tracheophytes represent more than 90 percent of Earth ’s vegetation ."	"0"
" 888 . Phloem is the second type of vascular tissue ; it transports sugars , proteins , and other solutes throughout the plant ."	"1"
" Phloem cells are divided into sieve elements ( conducting cells ) and cells that support the sieve elements ."	"0"
" 891 . Microphylls may have originated from the flattening of lateral branches , or from sporangia that lost their reproductive capabilities ."	"0"
" Microphylls are present in the club mosses and probably preceded the development of megaphylls , or “ big leaves ” , which are larger leaves with a pattern of branching veins ."	"1"
" Microphylls are present in the club mosses and probably preceded the development of megaphylls , or “ big leaves ” , which are larger leaves with a pattern of branching veins ."	"1"
" Megaphylls most likely appeared independently several times during the course of evolution ."	"0"
" 894 . The club mosses , or phylum Lycopodiophyta , are the earliest group of seedless vascular plants ."	"1"
" They dominated the landscape of the Carboniferous , growing into tall trees and forming large swamp forests ."	"0"
" 897 . Phylum Monilophyta : Class Psilotopsida ( Ferns)With their large fronds , ferns are the most readily recognizable seedless vascular plants ."	"0"
" They are considered the most advanced seedless vascular plants and display characteristics commonly observed in seed plants ."	"1"
" 900 . Gymnosperms , meaning “ naked seeds , ” are a diverse group of seed plants and are paraphyletic ."	"1"
" Paraphyletic groups are those in which not all members are descendants of a single common ancestor ."	"1"
" 903 . The male and female reproductive organs can form in cones or strobili ."	"0"
" Male and female sporangia are produced either on the same plant , described as monoecious ( “ one home ” or bisexual ) , or on separate plants , referred to as dioecious ( “ two homes ” or unisexual ) plants ."	"1"
" The life cycle of a conifer will serve as our example of reproduction in gymnosperms ."	"0"
" 906 . Female cones , or ovulate cones , contain two ovules per scale ."	"0"
" One megaspore mother cell , or megasporocyte , undergoes meiosis in each ovule ."	"0"
" Three of the four cells break down ; only a single surviving cell will develop into a female multicellular gametophyte , which encloses archegonia ( an archegonium is a reproductive organ that contains a single large egg ) ."	"1"
