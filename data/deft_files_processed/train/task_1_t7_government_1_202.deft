" 6467 . Why do we have two parties ?"	"0"
" The two - party system came into being because the structure of U.S. elections , with one seat tied to a geographic district , tends to lead to dominance by two major political parties ."	"0"
" Even when there are other options on the ballot , most voters understand that minor parties have no real chance of winning even a single office ."	"0"
" 6470 . Plurality voting , commonly referred to as first - past - the - post , is based on the principle that the individual candidate with the most votes wins , whether or not he or she gains a majority ( 51 percent or greater ) of the total votes cast ."	"1"
" For instance , Abraham Lincoln won the presidency in 1860 even though he clearly lacked majority support given the number of candidates in the race ."	"0"
" In 1860 , four candidates competed for the presidency : Lincoln , a Republican ; two Democrats , one from the northern wing of the party and one from the southern wing ; and a member of the newly formed Constitutional Union Party , a southern party that wished to prevent the nation from dividing over the issue of slavery ."	"0"
" 6473 . Abandoning plurality voting , even if the winner - take - all election were kept , would almost certainly increase the number of parties from which voters could choose ."	"0"
" The easiest switch would be to a majoritarian voting scheme , in which a candidate wins only if he or she enjoys the support of a majority of voters ."	"1"
" If no candidate wins a majority in the first round of voting , a run - off election is held among the top contenders ."	"0"
" 6476 . Scholars of voting behavior have also suggested at least three other characteristics of the U.S. system that are likely to influence party outcomes : the Electoral College , demobilized ethnicity , and campaign and election laws ."	"0"
" First , the United States has a presidential system in which the winner is selected not directly by the popular vote but indirectly by a group of electors known collectively as the Electoral College ."	"0"
" 6479 . One of the best - known party realignments occurred when Democrats moved to include African Americans and other minorities into their national coalition during the Great Depression ."	"0"

" 6482 . Roosevelt won the election with almost 58 percent of the popular vote and 472 Electoral College votes , compared to incumbent Herbert Hoover ’s 59 ."	"0"
" The 1932 election is considered an example of a critical election , one that represents a sudden , clear , and long - term shift in voter allegiances ."	"1"
" After this election , the political parties were largely identified as being divided by differences in their members ’ socio - economic status ."	"0"
" 6485 . They are part of what is known as the party organization ."	"0"
" The party organization is the formal structure of the political party , and its active members are responsible for coordinating party behavior and supporting party candidates ."	"1"
" It is a vital component of any successful party because it bears most of the responsibility for building and maintaining the party “ brand . ” It also plays a key role in helping select , and elect , candidates for public office ."	"0"
" 6488 . First , many Americans , especially young people , are more interested in the topics discussed at the national level than at the state or local level ."	"0"
" According to John Green of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics , “ Local elections tend to be about things like sewers , and roads and police protection — which are not as dramatic an issue as same - sex marriage or global warming or international affairs . ”"	"0"

" Presidential elections and the behavior of the U.S. Congress are also far more likely to make the news broadcasts than the activities of county commissioners , and the national - level party organization is mostly responsible for coordinating the activities of participants at this level ."	"0"
" The national party is a fundraising army for presidential candidates and also serves a key role in trying to coordinate and direct the efforts of the House and Senate ."	"0"
" 6491 . One of the first challenges facing the party - in - government , or the party identifiers who have been elected or appointed to hold public office , is to achieve their policy goals ."	"1"
" The means to do this is chosen in meetings of the two major parties ; Republican meetings are called party conferences and Democrat meetings are called party caucuses ."	"1"
" 6494 . Key benefits like committee appointments , leadership positions , and money for important projects in their home district may hinge on legislators following the lead of the party ."	"0"
" These pressures are particularly acute for the majority party , so named because it controls more than half the seats in one of the two chambers ."	"1"
" The Speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader , the majority party ’s congressional leaders , have significant tools at their disposal to punish party members who defect on a particular vote ."	"0"
" 6497 . For the first few decades of the current pattern of divided government , the threat it posed to the government appears to have been muted by a high degree of bipartisanship , or cooperation through compromise ."	"1"
" Many pieces of legislation were passed in the 1960s and 1970s with reasonably high levels of support from both parties ."	"0"
" 6500 . Movements on the left have also arisen ."	"0"
" The Occupy Wall Street movement was born of the government ’s response to the Great Recession of 2008 and its assistance to endangered financial institutions , provided through the Troubled Asset Relief Program , TARP ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" The Occupy Movement believed the recession was caused by a failure of the government to properly regulate the banking industry ."	"0"
" 6503 . Several conflicting theories have been offered ."	"0"
" The first and perhaps best argument is that polarization is a party - in - government phenomenon driven by a decades - long sorting of the voting public , or a change in party allegiance in response to shifts in party position ."	"0"
" Morris Fiorina , “ Americans Have Not Become More Politically Polarized , ” The Washington Post , 23 June 2014 ."	"0"
" According to the sorting thesis , before the 1950s , voters were mostly concerned with state - level party positions rather than national party concerns ."	"0"
" Since parties are bottom - up institutions , this meant local issues dominated elections ; it also meant national - level politicians typically paid more attention to local problems than to national party politics ."	"0"
" 6506 . Before then , it was common for many states to practice redistricting , or redrawing of their electoral maps , only if they gained or lost seats in the U.S. House of Representatives ."	"1"
" This can happen once every ten years as a result of a constitutionally mandated reapportionment process , in which the number of House seats given to each state is adjusted to account for population changes ."	"0"
" 6509 . According to political scientist Nolan McCarty , there is little evidence to support the redistricting hypothesis alone ."	"0"
" First , he argues , the Senate has become polarized just as the House of Representatives has , but people vote for Senators on a statewide basis ."	"0"
" 6512 . In Federalist No. 10 , written in the late eighteenth century , James Madison noted that the formation of self - interested groups , which he called factions , was inevitable in any society , as individuals started to work together to protect themselves from the government ."	"1"
" Interest groups and political parties are two of the most easily identified forms of factions in the United States ."	"0"
" 6518 . However , members of each faction quickly realized that they had a vested interest not only in nominating and electing a president who shared their views , but also in winning other elections ."	"0"
" Two loosely affiliated party coalitions , known as the Federalists and the Democratic - Republicans , soon emerged ."	"0"
" The Federalists succeeded in electing their first leader , John Adams , to the presidency in 1796 , only to see the Democratic - Republicans gain victory under Thomas Jefferson four years later in 1800 ."	"0"
" 6521 . Andrew Jackson won more popular votes and more votes in the Electoral College than any other candidate ."	"0"
" However , because he did not win the majority ( more than half ) of the available electoral votes , the election was decided by the House of Representatives , as required by the Twelfth Amendment ."	"0"
" The Twelfth Amendment limited the House ’s choice to the three candidates with the greatest number of electoral votes ."	"0"
" 6524 . New York : Oxford University Press , 330 - 34 ."	"0"
" Many of these positions were given to party bosses and their friends ."	"0"
" These men were the leaders of political machines , organizations that secured votes for the party ’s candidates or supported the party in other ways ."	"1"
" Perhaps more importantly , this election - focused organization also sought to maintain power by creating a broader coalition and thereby expanding the range of issues upon which the party was constructed ."	"0"
" Sean Wilentz ."	"0"
" 6527 . Roosevelt attempted to form a third party , known as the Progressive Party , as an alternative to the more business - minded Republicans ."	"0"

" First , interest groups may take the form of membership organizations , which individuals join voluntarily and to which they usually pay dues ."	"1"
" Membership groups often consist of people who have common issues or concerns , or who want to be with others who share their views ."	"0"
" 6539 . Interest groups also include associations , which are typically groups of institutions that join with others , often within the same trade or industry ( trade associations ) , and have similar concerns ."	"0"

" A civil rights group like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) will keep track of proposed voter - identification bills in state legislatures that might have an effect on voting rights ."	"0"
" This organization will contact lawmakers to voice approval or disapproval of proposed legislation ( inside lobbying ) and encourage group members to take action by either donating money to it or contacting lawmakers about the proposed bill ( outside lobbying ) ."	"0"
" 6545 . On the other hand , public interest groups attempt to promote public , or collective , goods ."	"0"
" Such collective goods are benefits — tangible or intangible — that help most or all citizens ."	"1"
" These goods are often produced collectively , and because they may not be profitable and everyone may not agree on what public goods are best for society , they are often underfunded and thus will be underproduced unless there is government involvement ."	"0"
" 6548 . Group leaders also play an important role in overcoming collective action problems ."	"0"

" Some interest groups develop as grassroots movements , which often begin from the bottom up among a small number of people at the local level ."	"1"
