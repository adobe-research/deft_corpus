" 884 . A structure called a peristome increases the spread of spores after the tip of the capsule falls off at dispersal ."	"1"
" The concentric tissue around the mouth of the capsule is made of triangular , close - fitting units , a little like “ teeth ” ; these open and close depending on moisture levels , and periodically release spores ."	"0"
" 887 . The tissue consists of conducting cells , known as tracheids , and supportive filler tissue , called parenchyma ."	"1"
" Xylem conductive cells incorporate the compound lignin into their walls , and are thus described as lignified ."	"1"
" Lignin itself is a complex polymer that is impermeable to water and confers mechanical strength to vascular tissue ."	"1"
" 893 . Pine cones , mature fronds of ferns , and flowers are all sporophylls — leaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia ."	"1"
" Strobili are cone - like structures that contain sporangia ."	"1"
" They are prominent in conifers and are commonly known as pine cones ."	"0"
" 896 . Phylum Monilophyta : Class Psilotopsida ( Whisk Ferns )"	"0"
" While most ferns form large leaves and branching roots , the whisk ferns , Class Psilotopsida , lack both roots and leaves , probably lost by reduction ."	"0"
" Photosynthesis takes place in their green stems , and small yellow knobs form at the tip of the branch stem and contain the sporangia ."	"0"
" 902 . Some seeds are enveloped by sporophyte tissues upon maturation ."	"0"
" The layer of sporophyte tissue that surrounds the megasporangium , and later , the embryo , is called the integument ."	"1"
" 905 . Female cones , or ovulate cones , contain two ovules per scale ."	"0"
" One megaspore mother cell , or megasporocyte , undergoes meiosis in each ovule ."	"0"
" 908 . Cycads thrive in mild climates , and are often mistaken for palms because of the shape of their large , compound leaves ."	"0"
" Cycads bear large cones ( [ link ] ) , and may be pollinated by beetles rather than wind : unusual for a gymnosperm ."	"0"
