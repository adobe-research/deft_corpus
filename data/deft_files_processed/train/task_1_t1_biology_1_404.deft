" 1498 . One very important second messenger is cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) ."	"0"
" When a hormone binds to its membrane receptor , a G - protein that is associated with the receptor is activated ; G - proteins are proteins separate from receptors that are found in the cell membrane ."	"1"
" When a hormone is not bound to the receptor , the G - protein is inactive and is bound to guanosine diphosphate , or GDP ."	"0"
" 1501 . The term “ humoral ” is derived from the term “ humor , ” which refers to bodily fluids such as blood ."	"1"
" A humoral stimulus refers to the control of hormone release in response to changes in extracellular fluids such as blood or the ion concentration in the blood ."	"1"
" For example , a rise in blood glucose levels triggers the pancreatic release of insulin ."	"0"
" 1504 . Because the neurons can regulate the release of hormones , the nervous and endocrine systems work in a coordinated manner to regulate the body 's physiology ."	"0"
" Hypothalamic - Pituitary AxisThe hypothalamus in vertebrates integrates the endocrine and nervous systems ."	"0"
" The hypothalamus is an endocrine organ located in the diencephalon of the brain ."	"1"
" 1507 . The anterior pituitary gland , or adenohypophysis , is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus , down along the infundibulum , and to the anterior pituitary ."	"1"
" This capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system ."	"1"
" 1510 . The thyroid gland is located in the neck , just below the larynx and in front of the trachea , as shown in [ link ] ."	"0"
" It is a butterfly - shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus ."	"0"
" 1513 . Follicle cells are stimulated to release stored T3 and T4 by thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , which is produced by the anterior pituitary ."	"0"
" These thyroid hormones increase the rates of mitochondrial ATP production ."	"0"
" A third hormone , calcitonin , is produced by parafollicular cells of the thyroid either releasing hormones or inhibiting hormones ."	"0"
" Calcitonin release is not controlled by TSH , but instead is released when calcium ion concentrations in the blood rise ."	"0"
