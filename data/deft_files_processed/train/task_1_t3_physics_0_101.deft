" It is used to reduce pest infestation and to delay spoilage and prevent illness caused by microorganisms ."	"0"
" 3232 . Nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two nuclei are combined , or fused , to form a larger nucleus ."	"1"
" We know that all nuclei have less mass than the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons that form them ."	"0"
" 3235 . Break - even has nearly been reached and gives hope that ignition and commercial plants may become a reality in a few decades . Two techniques have shown considerable promise ."	"0"
" The first of these is called magnetic confinement and uses the property that charged particles have difficulty crossing magnetic field lines ."	"1"
" The tokamak , shown in [ link ] , has shown particular promise ."	"0"
" 3238 . Being chargeless , even low - energy neutrons can strike a nucleus and be absorbed once they feel the attractive nuclear force ."	"0"
" Large nuclei are described by a liquid drop model with surface tension and oscillation modes , because the large number of nucleons act like atoms in a drop ."	"0"
" The neutron is attracted and thus , deposits energy , causing the nucleus to deform as a liquid drop ."	"0"
" 3241 . Control rods containing nuclides that very strongly absorb neutrons are used to adjust neutron flux ."	"0"
" To produce large power , reactors contain hundreds to thousands of critical masses , and the chain reaction easily becomes self - sustaining , a condition called criticality ."	"1"
" Neutron flux should be carefully regulated to avoid an exponential increase in fissions , a condition called supercriticality ."	"1"
" 3244 . Exploring the systematic behavior of their interactions has revealed even more about matter , forces , and energy ."	"0"
" Particle physics deals with the substructures of atoms and nuclei and is particularly aimed at finding those truly fundamental particles that have no further substructure ."	"1"
" Just as in atomic and nuclear physics , we have found a complex array of particles and properties with systematic characteristics analogous to the periodic table and the chart of nuclides ."	"0"
