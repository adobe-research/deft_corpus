" 3315 . During the egg 's journey from the ovary through the fallopian tubes , to the uterus , a sperm may fertilize an egg . The egg and the sperm each contain 23 chromosomes ."	"0"
" Chromosomes are long strings of genetic material known as deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ."	"1"
" DNA is a helix - shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs ."	"1"
" 3318 . Therefore , each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring ; the resulting physical characteristics of the offspring ( called the phenotype ) are determined by the interaction of genetic material supplied by the parents ( called the genotype ) ."	"1"
" A person ’s genotype is the genetic makeup of that individual ."	"1"
" Phenotype , on the other hand , refers to the individual ’s inherited physical characteristics , which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences ( [ link ] ) ."	"1"

" Height is one example of a polygenic trait , as are skin color and weight . In this Punnett square , N represents the normal allele , and p represents the recessive allele that is associated with PKU ."	"0"
" 3330 . Each of us represents a unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment ; range of reaction is one way to describe this interaction ."	"0"
" Range of reaction asserts that our genes set the boundaries within which we can operate , and our environment interacts with the genes to determine where in that range we will fall ."	"1"
" For example , if an individual ’s genetic makeup predisposes her to high levels of intellectual potential and she is reared in a rich , stimulating environment , then she will be more likely to achieve her full potential than if she were raised under conditions of significant deprivation ."	"0"
" 3333 . As mentioned earlier , gene expression is often influenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious ."	"0"
" For instance , identical twins share the same genetic information ( identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg that split , so the genetic material is exactly the same in each ; in contrast , fraternal twins develop from two different eggs fertilized by different sperm , so the genetic material varies as with non - twin siblings ) ."

" 3351 . Between signals , the neuron membrane ’s potential is held in a state of readiness , called the resting potential ."	"1"
" Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action , ions line up on either side of the cell membrane , ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates ( i.e. , a sodium - potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane ) ."	"0"
" 3354 . This positive spike constitutes the action potential : the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body down the axon to the axon terminals ."	"1"
" The electrical signal moves down the axon like a wave ; at each point , some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon , raising the charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions ."	"0"
" 3357 . The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron , and the process repeats itself in the new neuron ( assuming the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential ) ."	"0"
" Once the signal is delivered , excess neurotransmitters in the synapse drift away , are broken down into inactive fragments , or are reabsorbed in a process known as reuptake ."	"0"
" Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron that released it , in order to clear the synapse ( [ link ] ) ."	"1"

" Repeated use of these stimulants can have significant adverse consequences ."	"0"
" 3570 . An opioid is one of a category of drugs that includes heroin , morphine , methadone , and codeine ."	"1"
" Opioids have analgesic properties ; that is , they decrease pain ."	"0"
" 3573 . Methadone is a synthetic opioid that is less euphorigenic than heroin and similar drugs ."	"1"
" Methadone clinics help people who previously struggled with opioid addiction manage withdrawal symptoms through the use of methadone ."	"1"
" Other drugs , including the opioid buprenorphine , have also been used to alleviate symptoms of opiate withdrawal ."	"0"
" 3576 . Hypnosis is a state of extreme self - focus and attention in which minimal attention is given to external stimuli ."	"1"
" In the therapeutic setting , a clinician may use relaxation and suggestion in an attempt to alter the thoughts and perceptions of a patient ."	"0"
" 3579 . These cells relay messages , in the form of action potentials ( as you learned when studying biopsychology ) , to the central nervous system ."	"0"
" The conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as transduction ."	"1"
" 3582 . Sometimes , we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required to detect a difference between them ."	"1"
" This is known as the just noticeable difference ( jnd ) or difference threshold ."	"0"
" This is known as the just noticeable difference ( jnd ) or difference threshold ."	"0"
" Unlike the absolute threshold , the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulus intensity ."	"0"
" 3585 . On the other hand , how we interpret those sensations is influenced by our available knowledge , our experiences , and our thoughts ."	"1"
" This is called top - down processing ."	"0"
" This is called top - down processing ."	"0"
" 3588 . If so , then you have experienced how motivation to detect a meaningful stimulus can shift our ability to discriminate between a true sensory stimulus and background noise ."	"0"
" The ability to identify a stimulus when it is embedded in a distracting background is called signal detection theory ."	"1"
" This might also explain why a mother is awakened by a quiet murmur from her baby but not by other sounds that occur while she is asleep ."	"0"
" 3591 . Two physical characteristics of a wave are amplitude and wavelength ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" The amplitude of a wave is the height of a wave as measured from the highest point on the wave ( peak or crest ) to the lowest point on the wave ( trough ) ."	"1"
" Wavelength refers to the length of a wave from one peak to the next ."	"1"
" 3594 . The visible spectrum is the portion of the larger electromagnetic spectrum that we can see ."	"1"
" As [ link ] shows , the electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all of the electromagnetic radiation that occurs in our environment and includes gamma rays , x - rays , ultraviolet light , visible light , infrared light , microwaves , and radio waves ."	"0"
" 3597 . This is known as the timbre of a sound ."	"0"
" Timbre refers to a sound ’s purity , and it is affected by the complex interplay of frequency , amplitude , and timing of sound waves ."	"1"
" 3600 . It serves as a barrier between the inner eye and the outside world , and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter the eye ."	"0"
" The pupil is the small opening in the eye through which light passes , and the size of the pupil can change as a function of light levels as well as emotional arousal ."	"1"
" When light levels are low , the pupil will become dilated , or expanded , to allow more light to enter the eye ."	"0"
" 3603 . The lens is attached to muscles that can change its shape to aid in focusing light that is reflected from near or far objects ."	"0"
" In a normal - sighted individual , the lens will focus images perfectly on a small indentation in the back of the eye known as the fovea , which is part of the retina , the light - sensitive lining of the eye ."	"1"
" The fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" 3606 . While cones are concentrated in the fovea , where images tend to be focused , rods , another type of photoreceptor , are located throughout the remainder of the retina ."	"0"
" Rods are specialized photoreceptors that work well in low light conditions , and while they lack the spatial resolution and color function of the cones , they are involved in our vision in dimly lit environments as well as in our perception of movement on the periphery of our visual field ."	"1"
" 3609 . The optic nerve from each eye merges just below the brain at a point called the optic chiasm ."	"1"
" As [ link ] shows , the optic chiasm is an X - shaped structure that sits just below the cerebral cortex at the front of the brain ."	"0"
" 3612 . The trichromatic theory of color vision is not the only theory — another major theory of color vision is known as the opponent - process theory ."	"0"
" According to this theory , color is coded in opponent pairs : black - white , yellow - blue , and green - red ."	"1"
