" This question can be answered by calculating a country ’s GDP per capita ; that is , the GDP divided by the population ."	"1"
" 4801 . GDP has nothing to say about the level of inequality in society ."	"0"
" GDP per capita is only an average ."	"0"

" To understand economic growth , which is really concerned with the growth in living standards of an average person , it is often useful to focus on GDP per capita ."	"0"

" For union workers operating under a multiyear contract with a company , wage cuts might violate the contract and create a labor dispute or a strike ."	"0"
" 4840 . Efficiency wage theory argues that the productivity of workers depends on their pay , and so employers will often find it worthwhile to pay their employees somewhat more than market conditions might dictate ."	"1"
" One reason is that employees who are paid better than others will be more productive because they recognize that if they were to lose their current jobs , they would suffer a decline in salary ."	"0"
" 4843 . The insider - outsider model of the labor force , in simple terms , argues that those already working for firms are “ insiders , ” while new employees , at least for a time , are “ outsiders . ”"	"1"
" A firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization , to be familiar with routine procedures , to train new employees , and so on ."	"0"
" However , cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm ’s productivity and prospects ."	"0"
" Finally , the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline , there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan ."	"1"
" Instead , workers confronted with the possibility of a wage cut will worry that other workers will not have such a wage cut , and so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms and relative to others ."	"0"
" 4846 . But in the real world , even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies , it takes time to find out about new jobs , to interview and figure out if the new job is a good match , or perhaps to sell a house and buy another in proximity to a new job ."	"0"
" The unemployment that occurs in the meantime , as workers move between jobs , is called frictional unemployment ."	"1"
" Frictional unemployment is not inherently a bad thing ."	"0"
" 4849 . Inflation is a general and ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy ."	"1"
" Inflation does not refer to a change in relative prices ."	"0"
" 4852 . To calculate the price level , economists begin with the concept of a basket of goods and services , consisting of the different items individuals , businesses , or organizations typically buy ."	"0"
" The next step is to look at how the prices of those items change over time ."	"0"
" 4855 . Price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time ."	"1"
" To convert the money spent on the basket to an index number , economists arbitrarily choose one year to be the base year , or starting point from which we measure changes in prices ."	"0"
" The base year , by definition , has an index number equal to 100 ."	"0"
" 4858 . A fixed and unchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods , regardless of price changes — not a very likely assumption ."	"0"
" Thus , substitution bias — the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time — tends to overstate the rise in a consumer ’s true cost of living , because it does not take into account that the person can substitute away from goods whose relative prices have risen ."	"1"
" 4861 . The BLS also calculates several price indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods ."	"0"
" For example , the Producer Price Index ( PPI ) is based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and services ."	"1"

" 4864 . An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market ."	"0"
" The GDP deflator , measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis , is a price index that includes all the components of GDP ( that is , consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports ) ."	"1"

" 4870 . Economists note that over most periods , the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in wages , and so they reason that , on average , over time , people ’s economic status is not greatly changed by inflation ."	"0"
" If all prices , wages , and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation , as in the Land of Funny Money , then no one ’s purchasing power , profits , or real loan payments would change ."	"0"
