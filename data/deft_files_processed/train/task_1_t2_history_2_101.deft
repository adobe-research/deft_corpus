" 2556 . The Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of race , color , national origin , and religion , also prohibited , in Title VII , discrimination on the basis of sex ."	"1"
" Ironically , protection for women had been included at the suggestion of a Virginia congressman in an attempt to prevent the act ’s passage ; his reasoning seemed to be that , while a white man might accept that African Americans needed and deserved protection from discrimination , the idea that women deserved equality with men would be far too radical for any of his male colleagues to contemplate ."
