" This is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job ."	"1"
" 4832 . One reason is that the statistical agencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the U.S. Bureau of the Census ."	"0"
" But a more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in many low - income countries , most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly ."	"0"

" 4835 . From the standpoint of the supply - and - demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets , unemployment represents something of a puzzle ."	"0"
" In a supply - and - demand model of a labor market , as illustrated in [ link ] , the labor market should move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity ."	"1"

" A number of different theories have been proposed , but they share a common tone ."	"0"
" 4841 . The adverse selection of wage cuts argument points out that if an employer reacts to poor business conditions by reducing wages for all workers , then the best workers , those with the best employment alternatives at other firms , are the most likely to leave ."	"1"
" The least attractive workers , with fewer employment alternatives , are more likely to stay ."	"0"
" 4844 . Why are unemployment rates continually higher in certain economies , through good economic years and bad ?"	"0"
" Economists have a term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the economy is healthy : it is called the natural rate of unemployment ."	"1"
" 4847 . Another factor that influences the natural rate of unemployment is the amount of structural unemployment ."	"0"
" The structurally unemployed are individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued by the labor market , either because demand has shifted away from the skills they do have , or because they never learned any skills ."	"1"

" The CPI is calculated by government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four ."	"1"
" 4859 . If the new good is not included in the CPI for some years , until its price is already lower , the CPI may miss counting this price decline altogether ."	"0"
" Taking these arguments together , the quality / new goods bias means that the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a consumer ’s true cost of living , because it does not take into account how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the invention of new goods improves the standard of living ."

" However , there are also two periods of severe negative inflation — called deflation — in the early decades of the twentieth century : one following the deep recession of 1920–21 and the other during the Great Depression of the 1930s ."	"1"

" 4868 . Economists usually oppose high inflation , but they oppose it in a milder way than many non - economists ."	"0"
" Robert Shiller , one of 2013 ’s Nobel Prize winners in economics , carried out several surveys during the 1990s about attitudes toward inflation ."	"0"
" One of his questions asked , “ Do you agree that preventing high inflation is an important national priority , as important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration in the quality of our schools ? ”"	"0"
" Answers were on a scale of 1–5 , where 1 meant “ Fully agree ” and 5 meant “ Completely disagree . ” For the U.S. population as a whole , 52 % answered “ Fully agree ” that preventing high inflation was a highly important national priority and just 4 % said “ Completely disagree . ” However , among professional economists , only 18 % answered “ Fully agree , ” while the same percentage of 18 % answered “ Completely disagree . ”"	"0"
" The Land of Funny Money"	"0"
" 4871 . If all prices , wages , and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation , as in the Land of Funny Money , then no one ’s purchasing power , profits , or real loan payments would change ."	"0"
" However , if other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation , or if they adjust for inflation only after a time lag , then inflation can cause three types of problems : unintended redistributions of purchasing power , blurred price signals , and difficulties in long - term planning ."

" 4874 . One sizable group of people has often received a large share of their income in a form that does not increase over time : retirees who receive a private company pension ."	"0"
" Most pensions have traditionally been set as a fixed nominal dollar amount per year at retirement ."	"1"
" For this reason , pensions are called “ defined benefits ” plans ."	"0"
" 4877 . High and variable inflation means that the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes in prices are weaker ."	"1"
" Markets will adjust toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly , and many individual markets will experience a greater chance of surpluses and shortages ."	"0"
" 4880 . When a price , wage , or interest rate is adjusted automatically with inflation , it is said to be indexed ."	"1"
" An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation ."	"1"
" 4883 . Loans often have built - in inflation adjustments , too , so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points , then the interest rate charged on the loan rises by two percentage points as well ."	"0"
" An adjustable - rate mortgage ( ARM ) is a kind of loan used to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies with the rate of inflation ."	"1"

" 4886 . The balance of trade ( or trade balance ) is any gap between a nation ’s dollar value of its exports , or what its producers sell abroad , and a nation ’s dollar worth of imports , or the foreign - made products and services that households and businesses purchase ."	"1"
" Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports , the economy is said to have a trade surplus ."	"0"
" 4889 . At some point , foreign investors become pessimistic about the economy and move their money to other countries ."	"0"
" The economy then drops into deep recession , with real GDP often falling up to 10 % or more in a single year ."	"0"
" This happened to Mexico in 1995 when their GDP fell 8.1 % ."	"0"
" 4892 . Do not confuse the balance of trade ( which tracks imports and exports ) , with the current account balance , which includes not just exports and imports , but also income from investment and transfers ."	"0"
" 4895 . Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods , the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades ."	"0"
" For example , U.S. exports of services were equal to about one - half of U.S. exports of goods in 2014 , compared to one - fifth in 1980.The third component of the current account balance , labeled “ income payments , ” refers to money received by U.S. financial investors on their foreign investments ( money flowing into the United States ) and payments to foreign investors who had invested their funds here ( money flowing out of the United States ) ."	"1"
" The reason for including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade , along with goods and services , is that , from an economic perspective , income is just as much an economic transaction as shipments of cars or wheat or oil : it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market ."	"0"
" 4898 . As economists see it , trade surpluses can be either good or bad , depending on circumstances , and trade deficits can be good or bad , too ."	"0"
" The challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and services are connected with international flows of financial capital ."	"0"
" In this module we will illustrate the intimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital in two ways : a parable of trade between Robinson Crusoe and Friday , and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments ."	"0"
" 4901 . Investment income stemming from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the home country ."	"0"
" Similarly , we see on the bottom third line , an investment from rest of the world into the home country and investment income ( bottom fourth line ) flowing from the home country to the rest of the world ."	"0"
" The investment income ( bottom lines two and four ) are found in the current account , while investment to the rest of the world or into the home country ( lines one and three ) are found in the financial account ."	"0"
" 4904 . The fundamental notion that total quantity of financial capital demanded equals total quantity of financial capital supplied must always remain true ."	"0"
" Domestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of financial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital ."	"0"
" 4907 . When Japan ’s economy was growing vigorously in the 1960s and 1970s , its large trade surpluses were often described , especially by non - economists , as either a cause or a result of its robust economic health ."	"0"
" But from a standpoint of economic growth , Japan ’s economy has been teetering in and out of recession since 1990 , with real GDP growth averaging only about 1 % per year , and an unemployment rate that has been creeping higher ."	"0"
" Clearly , a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of economic good health ."	"0"
" 4910 . How is the rate of economic growth connected to changes in the unemployment rate ?"	"0"
" Is there a reason why unemployment and inflation seem to move in opposite directions : lower unemployment and higher inflation from 1997 to 2000 , higher unemployment and lower inflation in the early 2000s , lower unemployment and higher inflation in the mid-2000s , and then higher unemployment and lower inflation in 2009 ?"	"0"
" Why did the current account deficit rise so high , but then decline in 2009 ?"	"0"
" 4913 . Those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous French economist of the early nineteenth century named Jean - Baptiste Say ( 1767 – 1832 ) ."	"0"
" Say ’s law is : “ Supply creates its own demand . ” As a matter of historical accuracy , it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs , but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view . The intuition behind Say ’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold , it generates income that is earned for someone : a worker , a manager , an owner , or those who are workers , managers , and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production ."

" The forces of supply and demand in individual markets will cause prices to rise and fall ."	"0"
" 4916 . Nevertheless , a recession is not a situation where all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes ."	"0"
" A recession is a situation in which the economy as a whole is shrinking in size , business failures outnumber the remaining success stories , and many firms end up suffering losses and laying off workers ."	"1"
" Say ’s law that supply creates its own demand does seem a good approximation for the long run ."	"0"
" Over periods of some years or decades , as the productive power of an economy to supply goods and services increases , total demand in the economy grows at roughly the same pace ."	"0"
