" 3227 . Therapeutic applications of ionizing radiation , called radiation therapy or radiotherapy , have existed since the discovery of x - rays and nuclear radioactivity ."	"1"
" Today , radiotherapy is used almost exclusively for cancer therapy , where it saves thousands of lives and improves the quality of life and longevity of many it can not save ."	"0"
" 3230 . How does food irradiation work ?"	"0"
" Ionization produces a random assortment of broken molecules and ions , some with unstable oxygen- or hydrogen - containing molecules known as free radicals ."	"1"
" These undergo rapid chemical reactions , producing perhaps four or five thousand different compounds called radiolytic products , some of which make cell function impossible by breaking cell membranes , fracturing DNA , and so on ."	"0"
" 3233 . These three factors — temperature , density , and time — complement one another , and so a deficiency in one can be compensated for by the others ."	"0"
" Ignition is defined to occur when the reactions produce enough energy to be self - sustaining after external energy input is cut off ."	"1"
" This goal , which must be reached before commercial plants can be a reality , has not been achieved ."	"0"
" 3236 . Huge power input heats the fuel , evaporating the confining pellet and crushing the fuel to high density with the expanding hot plasma produced ."	"1"
" This technique is called inertial confinement , because the fuel ’s inertia prevents it from escaping before significant fusion can take place ."	"0"
" This technique is called inertial confinement , because the fuel ’s inertia prevents it from escaping before significant fusion can take place ."	"0"
" Higher densities have been reached than with tokamaks , but with smaller confinement times ."	"0"
" 3239 . Coulomb repulsion between the two ends then succeeds in fissioning the nucleus , which pops like a water drop into two large pieces and a few neutrons ."	"0"
" Neutron - induced fission can be written as"	"0"
" 3242 . To produce large power , reactors contain hundreds to thousands of critical masses , and the chain reaction easily becomes self - sustaining , a condition called criticality ."	"1"
" Neutron flux should be carefully regulated to avoid an exponential increase in fissions , a condition called supercriticality ."	"1"
" Control rods help prevent overheating , perhaps even a meltdown or explosive disassembly ."	"0"
