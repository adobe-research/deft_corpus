" 4312 . Economics is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity ."	"1"
" These can be individual decisions , family decisions , business decisions or societal decisions ."	"0"
" 4315 . Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith , but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way ."	"0"
" In the first chapter , Smith introduces the division of labor , which means that the way a good or service is produced is divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers , instead of all the tasks being done by the same person ."	"1"
" 4321 . How can macroeconomic policy be used to pursue these goals ?"	"0"
" Monetary policy , which involves policies that affect bank lending , interest rates , and financial capital markets , is conducted by a nation ’s central bank ."	"1"
" For the United States , this is the Federal Reserve ."	"0"
" 4324 . They analyze issues and problems with economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior , that are different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use ."	"0"
" A theory is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other ."	"1"
" The purpose of a theory is to take a complex , real - world issue and simplify it down to its essentials ."	"0"
" 4327 . A good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram , which is shown in [ link ] ."	"0"
" It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups — households and firms — that interact in two markets : the goods and services market in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees ."	"1"
" 4330 . Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions , market economies have a very decentralized structure ."	"0"
" A market is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services , who may be either individuals or businesses ."	"1"
" The New York Stock Exchange , shown in [ link ] , is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together ."	"0"

" Imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically ."	"1"
" The size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product ( GDP ) ."	"1"
" 4339 . Economists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what must be given up to obtain something that is desired ."	"1"
" The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else ; in short , opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative ."	"0"
" 4342 . People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods and services provide ."	"0"
" Utility , as we will see in the chapter on Consumer Choices , is subjective but that does not make it less real ."	"0"
" 4345 . Just as individuals can not have everything they want and must instead make choices , society as a whole can not have everything it might want , either ."	"0"
" This section of the chapter will explain the constraints faced by society , using a model called the production possibilities frontier ( PPF ) ."	"0"
" There are more similarities than differences between individual choice and social choice ."	"0"
" 4348 . This pattern is common enough that it has been given a name : the law of diminishing returns , which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to a certain purpose , the marginal benefit from those additional increments will decline ."	"1"
" When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime , for example , the original gains in reducing crime could be relatively large ."	"0"
" 4351 . Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods a society produces represents the combination that society most desires ."	"1"
" How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question , and is usually discussed in political science , sociology , and philosophy classes as well as in economics ."	"0"
" 4354 . Rather , it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually exists ."	"0"
" Philosophers draw a distinction between positive statements , which describe the world as it is , and normative statements , which describe how the world should be ."	"0"
" For example , an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city ."	"0"
" 4357 . But even if the budget constraint or a PPF shifts , scarcity remains — just at a different level ."	"0"
" The second theme is tradeoffs ."	"0"
" As depicted in the budget constraint or the production possibilities frontier , it is necessary to give up some of one good to gain more of the other good ."	"0"

" An economist might say that people choose not to get a college degree because they may have to borrow money to go to college , and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today ."	"0"
" 4363 . Price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) and the corresponding percent change in price ."	"1"
" The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price ."	"1"
" The price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price ."	"1"
" Elasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories : elastic , inelastic , and unitary ."	"0"
" 4366 . An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price ."	"1"
" An elastic demand or elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one , indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price ."	"1"
" Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply ."	"1"
" Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or inelastic supply ."	"1"
" Unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply , as summarized in [ link ] ."	"1"
" 4369 . Recall that the elasticity between these two points was 0.45 ."	"0"
" Demand was inelastic between points A and B and elastic between points G and H. This shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along a straight - line demand curve ."	"0"
" 4372 . Zero elasticity or perfect inelasticity , as depicted in [ link ] refers to the extreme case in which a percentage change in price , no matter how large , results in zero change in quantity ."	"1"
" While a perfectly inelastic supply is an extreme example , goods with limited supply of inputs are likely to feature highly inelastic supply curves ."	"0"
" 4375 . The example of cigarette taxes showed that because demand is inelastic , taxes are not effective at reducing the equilibrium quantity of smoking , and they are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices ."	"0"
" The analysis , or manner , of how the burden of a tax is divided between consumers and producers is called tax incidence ."	"1"
" Typically , the incidence , or burden , of a tax falls both on the consumers and producers of the taxed good ."	"0"
" 4378 . The cross - price elasticity of demand puts some meat on the bones of these ideas ."	"0"
" The term “ cross - price ” refers to the idea that the price of one good is affecting the quantity demanded of a different good ."	"1"
" 4381 . Let ’s define what is meant by the firm ."	"0"
" A firm ( or business ) combines inputs of labor , capital , land , and raw or finished component materials to produce outputs ."	"1"
" If the firm is successful , the outputs are more valuable than the inputs ."	"0"
" 4384 . We can distinguish between two types of cost : explicit and implicit ."	"0"
" Explicit costs are out - of - pocket costs , that is , payments that are actually made ."	"1"
" Wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs ."	"0"
" 4387 . It means total revenue minus explicit costs — the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out ."	"0"
" Economic profit is total revenue minus total cost , including both explicit and implicit costs ."	"1"
" The difference is important because even though a business pays income taxes based on its accounting profit , whether or not it is economically successful depends on its economic profit ."	"0"
" 4390 . Fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of production , at least not in the short term ."	"1"
" Whether you produce a lot or a little , the fixed costs are the same ."	"0"
" 4393 . Average total cost ( sometimes referred to simply as average cost ) is total cost divided by the quantity of output ."	"1"
" Since the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is $ 320 , the average total cost for producing each of 40 haircuts is $ 320/40 , or $ 8 per haircut ."	"0"
" 4402 . Finally , the right - hand portion of the long - run average cost curve , running from output level Q4 to Q5 , shows a situation where , as the level of output and the scale rises , average costs rise as well ."	"1"
" This situation is called diseconomies of scale ."	"0"
" This situation is called diseconomies of scale ."	"0"
" A firm or a factory can grow so large that it becomes very difficult to manage , resulting in unnecessarily high costs as many layers of management try to communicate with workers and with each other , and as failures to communicate lead to disruptions in the flow of work and materials ."	"0"
" 4405 . What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price ."	"1"
" The total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded ."	"1"
" 4411 . When economists talk about supply , they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price ."	"1"
" Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service ."	"1"
" A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service , while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied ."	"0"
" 4414 . Like demand , supply can be illustrated using a table or a graph ."	"0"
" A supply schedule is a table , like [ link ] , that shows the quantity supplied at a range of different prices ."	"1"
" Again , price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of gallons ."	"0"
" 4417 . The point where the supply curve ( S ) and the demand curve ( D ) cross , designated by point E in [ link ] , is called the equilibrium ."	"1"
" The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) ."	"1"
" The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree — that is , where the amount of the product consumers want to buy ( quantity demanded ) is equal to the amount producers want to sell ( quantity supplied ) ."	"1"
" This common quantity is called the equilibrium quantity ."	"0"
" 4420 . When the price is below equilibrium , there is excess demand , or a shortage — that is , at the given price the quantity demanded , which has been stimulated by the lower price , now exceeds the quantity supplied , which had been depressed by the lower price ."	"1"
" In this situation , eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations , only to find many stations running short of fuel ."	"0"
" 4423 . The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors , other than the product ’s price , are changing ."	"1"
" Economists call this assumption ceteris paribus , a Latin phrase meaning “ other things being equal . ”"	"0"
" Any given demand or supply curve is based on the ceteris paribus assumption that all else is held equal ."	"0"
" A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two , and only two , variables when all other variables are kept constant ."	"0"
" 4426 . The proportion of elderly citizens in the United States population is rising ."	"0"
" It rose from 9.8 % in 1970 to 12.6 % in 2000 , and will be a projected ( by the U.S. Census Bureau ) 20 % of the population by 2030 ."	"0"
" 4429 . These changes in demand are shown as shifts in the curve ."	"0"
" Therefore , a shift in demand happens when a change in some economic factor ( other than price ) causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price ."	"0"
" The following Work It Out feature shows how this happens ."	"0"
" 4432 . For example , in 2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China , which produces most of the country 's wheat , corn , and soybeans , experienced its most severe drought in 50 years ."	"0"
" A drought decreases the supply of agricultural products , which means that at any given price , a lower quantity will be supplied ; conversely , especially good weather would shift the supply curve to the right ."	"0"
" When a firm discovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost , the supply curve will shift to the right , as well ."	"0"
" For instance , in the 1960s a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice ."	"0"
" 4435 . “ Well , it is clear that a drought reduces supply , so I will shift back the supply curve , as in the shift from the original supply curve S0 to S1 shown on the diagram ( called Shift 1 ) ."	"0"
" So the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1 , the equilibrium quantity is lower and the equilibrium price is higher ."	"0"
" Then , a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good , so the supply curve shifts right , as shown by the shift from S1 to S2 , on the diagram ( shown as Shift 2 ) , so that the equilibrium now moves from E1 to E2 ."	"0"
" 4438 . The most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product , adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be ."	"0"
" According to the Common Agricultural Policy reform passed in 2013 , the European Union ( EU ) will spend about 60 billion euros per year , or 67 billion dollars per year , or roughly 38 % of the EU budget , on price supports for Europe ’s farmers from 2014 to 2020 ."	"0"
" [ link ] illustrates the effects of a government program that assures a price above the equilibrium by focusing on the market for wheat in Europe ."	"0"
" In the absence of government intervention , the price would adjust so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point E0 , with price P0 and quantity Q0 ."	"0"
" 4441 . At that above - equilibrium salary , excess supply or a surplus results ."	"0"
" In a situation of excess supply in the labor market , with many applicants for every job opening , employers will have an incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would have ."	"0"
" Nurses ’ salary will move down toward equilibrium . In contrast , if the salary is below the equilibrium at , say , $ 60,000 per year , then a situation of excess demand or a shortage arises ."	"0"
" 4444 . In mid- 2009 , the U.S. minimum wage was raised to $ 7.25 per hour ."	"0"
" Local political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a higher minimum wage , which they call a living wage ."	"0"
" Promoters of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure a reasonable standard of living ."	"0"
" 4447 . The laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial markets ."	"0"
" According to the law of demand , a higher rate of return ( that is , a higher price ) will decrease the quantity demanded ."	"1"
" As the interest rate rises , consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow ."	"0"
" 4450 . Instead , each consumer reacts according to that person ’s preferences and budget set , and each profit - seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits ."	"0"
" The following Clear It Up feature examines the demand and supply models ."	"0"
" 4453 . To understand how a household will make its choices , economists look at what consumers can afford , as shown in a budget constraint line , and the total utility or satisfaction derived from those choices ."	"0"
" In a budget constraint line , the quantity of one good is measured on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good is measured on the vertical axis ."	"1"
" 4456 . The most common pattern of total utility , as shown here , is that consuming additional goods leads to greater total utility , but at a decreasing rate ."	"0"
" The third column shows marginal utility , which is the additional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption ."	"1"
" This equation for marginal utility is : MU = change in total utility change in quantity MU = change in total utility change in quantity"	"0"
" Notice that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are consumed , which means that each subsequent unit of a good consumed provides less additional utility ."	"0"
" 4459 . This process of decision making suggests a rule to follow when maximizing utility ."	"0"
" Since the price of T - shirts is twice as high as the price of movies , to maximize utility the last T - shirt chosen needs to provide exactly twice the marginal utility ( MU ) of the last movie ."	"0"
" 4462 . How does this rise in income alter her utility - maximizing choice ?"	"0"
" Kimberly will again consider the utility and marginal utility that she receives from concert tickets and overnight getaways and seek her utility - maximizing choice on the new budget line ."	"0"
" But how will her new choice relate to her original choice ?"	"0"
" 4465 . This occurs for two reasons , and both effects can occur simultaneously ."	"0"
" The substitution effect occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price ."	"1"
" The income effect is that a higher price means , in effect , the buying power of income has been reduced ( even though actual income has not changed ) , which leads to buying less of the good ( when the good is normal ) ."	"1"
" 4468 . Again , let ’s proceed with a concrete example ."	"0"
" The economic logic is precisely the same as in the case of a consumption choice budget constraint , but the labels are different on a labor - leisure budget constraint ."	"0"
" 4471 . [ link ] and [ link ] show Yelberton ’s intertemporal budget constraint ."	"0"
" Yelberton ’s choice involves comparing the utility of present consumption during his working life and future consumption after retirement ."	"0"
" 4474 . And what ’s more , actions under these conditions are indeed predictable , if the underlying environment is better understood ."	"0"
" So , behavioral economics seeks to enrich the understanding of decision - making by integrating the insights of psychology into economics ."	"1"
" It does this by investigating how given dollar amounts can mean different things to individuals depending on the situation ."	"0"
" 4477 . Industries differ from one another in terms of how many sellers there are in a specific market , how easy or difficult it is for a new firm to enter , and the type of products that are sold ."	"1"
" This is referred to as the market structure of the industry ."	"0"
" In this chapter , we focus on perfect competition ."	"0"
" 4480 . A perfectly competitive firm has only one major decision to make — namely , what quantity to produce ."	"0"
" To understand why this is so , consider a different way of writing out the basic definition of profit :"	"0"
" 4483 . In this example , the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves cross at a price of $ 4 and a quantity of 80 produced ."	"0"
" If the farmer started out producing at a level of 60 , and then experimented with increasing production to 70 , marginal revenues from the increase in production would exceed marginal costs — and so profits would rise ."	"0"
" 4486 . No perfectly competitive firm acting alone can affect the market price ."	"0"
" However , the combination of many firms entering or exiting the market will affect overall supply in the market ."	"0"
" 4489 . For an increasing cost industry , as the market expands , the old and new firms experience increases in their costs of production , which makes the new zero - profit level intersect at a higher price than before ."	"1"
" Here companies may have to deal with limited inputs , such as skilled labor ."	"0"
" 4492 . To explore what is meant by allocative efficiency , it is useful to walk through an example ."	"0"
" Begin by assuming that the market for wholesale flowers is perfectly competitive , and so P = MC ."	"0"
" 4495 . There are two types of monopoly , based on the types of barriers to entry they exploit ."	"0"
" One is natural monopoly , where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition ."	"1"
" The other is legal monopoly , where laws prohibit ( or severely limit ) competition ."	"1"
" 4498 . Copyright Office ."	"0"
" A patent gives the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time ; in the United States , exclusive patent rights last for 20 years ."	"1"
" The idea is to provide limited monopoly power so that innovative firms can recoup their investment in R&D , but then to allow other firms to produce the product more cheaply once the patent expires ."	"0"
" 4501 . But in certain areas , like the invention of new software , it has been unclear whether patent or copyright protection should apply ."	"0"
" There is also a body of law known as trade secrets ."	"0"
" Even if a company does not have a patent on an invention , competing firms are not allowed to steal their secrets ."	"0"
" 4504 . Businesses have developed a number of schemes for creating barriers to entry by deterring potential competitors from entering the market ."	"0"
" One method is known as predatory pricing , in which a firm uses the threat of sharp price cuts to discourage competition ."	"1"
" Predatory pricing is a violation of U.S. antitrust law , but it is difficult to prove ."	"0"
" 4507 . For a perfect competitor , each additional unit sold brought a positive marginal revenue , because marginal revenue was equal to the given market price ."	"0"
" But a monopolist can sell a larger quantity and see a decline in total revenue ."	"0"
" When a monopolist increases sales by one unit , it gains some marginal revenue from selling that extra unit , but also loses some marginal revenue because every other unit must now be sold at a lower price ."	"0"
" 4510 . A perfectly competitive market has many firms selling identical products , who all act as price takers in the face of the competition ."	"0"
" If you recall , price takers are firms that have no market power ."	"1"
" They simply have to take the market price as given ."	"0"
" 4513 . Crew , and Nordstrom ’s ) , plus 14 more stores that sold women ’s specialty clothing ( like Motherhood Maternity and Victoria ’s Secret ) ."	"0"
" Most of the markets that consumers encounter at the retail level are monopolistically competitive ."	"0"
" The other type of imperfectly competitive market is oligopoly ."	"0"
" Oligopolistic markets are those dominated by a small number of firms ."	"1"
" 4516 . Some intangible aspects may be promises like a guarantee of satisfaction or money back , a reputation for high quality , services like free delivery , or offering a loan to purchase the product ."	"0"
" Finally , product differentiation may occur in the minds of buyers ."	"0"
" For example , many people could not tell the difference in taste between common varieties of beer or cigarettes if they were blindfolded but , because of past habits and advertising , they have strong preferences for certain brands ."	"0"
" 4519 . Although the process by which a monopolistic competitor makes decisions about quantity and price is similar to the way in which a monopolist makes such decisions , two differences are worth remembering ."	"0"
" First , although both a monopolist and a monopolistic competitor face downward - sloping demand curves , the monopolist ’s perceived demand curve is the market demand curve , while the perceived demand curve for a monopolistic competitor is based on the extent of its product differentiation and how many competitors it faces ."	"0"
" Second , a monopolist is surrounded by barriers to entry and need not fear entry , but a monopolistic competitor who earns profits must expect the entry of firms with similar , but differentiated , products ."	"0"
" 4522 . Thus , although a monopolistically competitive firm may earn positive economic profits in the short term , the process of new entry will drive down economic profits to zero in the long run ."	"0"
" Remember that zero economic profit is not equivalent to zero accounting profit ."	"0"
" A zero economic profit means the firm ’s accounting profit is equal to what its resources could earn in their next best use ."	"1"
" 4525 . Rather , they are oligopolies ."	"0"
" Oligopoly arises when a small number of large firms have all or most of the sales in an industry ."	"1"
" Examples of oligopoly abound and include the auto industry , cable television , and commercial air travel ."	"0"
" 4528 . By acting together , oligopolistic firms can hold down industry output , charge a higher price , and divide up the profit among themselves ."	"0"
" When firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high , it is called collusion ."	"1"
" A group of firms that have a formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a cartel ."	"1"
" 4531 . The desire of businesses to avoid competing so that they can instead raise the prices that they charge and earn higher profits has been well understood by economists ."	"0"
" Adam Smith wrote in Wealth of Nations in 1776 : “ People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public , or in some contrivance to raise prices . ”"	"0"
" 4534 . Each oligopolist , however , must worry that while it is holding down output , other firms are taking advantage of the high price by raising output and earning higher profits ."	"0"
" [ link ] shows the prisoner ’s dilemma for a two - firm oligopoly — known as a duopoly ."	"1"
" If Firms A and B both agree to hold down output , they are acting together as a monopoly and will each earn $ 1,000 in profits ."	"0"
" 4537 . One example of the pressure these firms can exert on one another is the kinked demand curve , in which competing oligopoly firms commit to match price cuts , but not price increases ."	"1"
" This situation is shown in [ link ] ."	"0"
" 4540 . A corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm ."	"0"
" When one firm purchases another , it is called an acquisition ."	"1"
" 4543 . In many cases , these large firms were organized in the legal form of a “ trust , ” in which a group of formerly independent firms were consolidated together by mergers and purchases , and a group of “ trustees ” then ran the companies as if they were a single firm ."	"1"
" Thus , when the U.S. government passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 to limit the power of these trusts , it was called an antitrust law ."	"0"
" In an early demonstration of the law ’s power , the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911 upheld the government ’s right to break up Standard Oil , which had controlled about 90 % of the country ’s oil refining , into 34 independent firms , including Exxon , Mobil , Amoco , and Chevron ."	"0"
" 4546 . Regulators have struggled for decades to measure the degree of monopoly power in an industry ."	"0"
" An early tool was the concentration ratio , which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms , typically the top four to eight firms ."	"1"
" For an explanation of how high market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy , refer to Monopoly ."	"0"
" Say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has 18 firms with the market shares shown in [ link ] , where the market share is each firm ’s proportion of total sales in that market ."	"1"
" 4549 . Defining a market is often controversial ."	"0"
" For example , Microsoft in the early 2000s had a dominant share of the software for computer operating systems ."	"0"
" 4552 . Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices — practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced , but that might have the effect of reducing competition ."	"1"
" Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial , because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others . For example , if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement , which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price ."	"0"
" 4555 . Tying sales happen when a customer is required to buy one product only if the customer also buys a second product ."	"1"
" Tying sales are controversial because they force consumers to purchase a product that they may not actually want or need ."	"0"
" 4558 . All sides agreed that the capabilities of computer software that was compatible with Windows — both software produced by Microsoft and that produced by other companies — had expanded dramatically in the 1990s ."	"0"
" Having a monopoly or a near - monopoly is not necessarily illegal in and of itself , but in cases where one company controls a great deal of the market , antitrust regulators look at any allegations of restrictive practices with special care ."	"0"
" 4561 . The regulators will try to choose a point along the market demand curve that benefits both consumers and the broader social interest ."	"0"
" Point C illustrates one tempting choice : the regulator requires that the firm produce the quantity of output where marginal cost crosses the demand curve at an output of 8 , and charge the price of 3.5 , which is equal to marginal cost at that point ."	"0"
" This rule is appealing because it requires price to be set equal to marginal cost , which is what would occur in a perfectly competitive market , and it would assure consumers a higher quantity and lower price than at the monopoly choice A ."	"0"
" 4564 . Beginning in the 1970s , it became clear to policymakers of all political leanings that the existing price regulation was not working well ."	"0"
" The United States carried out a great policy experiment — the deregulation discussed in Monopoly — removing government controls over prices and quantities produced in airlines , railroads , trucking , intercity bus travel , natural gas , and bank interest rates ."	"1"
" The Clear it Up discusses the outcome of deregulation in one industry in particular — airlines ."	"0"
" What are the results of airline deregulation ?"	"0"
" 4567 . The collapse of the markets for these assets precipitated the financial crisis and led to the failure of Lehman Brothers , a major investment bank , numerous large commercial banks , such as Wachovia , and even the Federal National Mortgage Corporation ( Fannie Mae ) , which had to be nationalized — that is , taken over by the federal government ."

" 4570 . The effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or “ external ” to the exchange is called an externality ."	"1"
" Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called spillovers . Externalities can be negative or positive ."	"0"
" If you hate country music , then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality ."	"0"
" 4573 . Pollution is a negative externality ."	"0"
" Economists illustrate the social costs of production with a demand and supply diagram ."	"0"
" The social costs include the private costs of production incurred by the company and the external costs of pollution that are passed on to society ."	"1"
" 4576 . However , when the externality of pollution exists , the supply curve no longer represents all social costs ."	"0"
" Because externalities represent a case where markets no longer consider all social costs , but only some of them , economists commonly refer to externalities as an example of market failure ."	"0"
" When there is market failure , the private market fails to achieve efficient output , because either firms do not account for all costs incurred in the production of output and/or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained ( a positive externality ) ."	"1"
" 4579 . In the same year , the Clean Air Act was enacted to address air pollution ."	"0"
" Just two years later , in 1972 , Congress passed and the president signed the far - reaching Clean Water Act ."	"0"
" These command - and - control environmental laws , and their amendments and updates , have been largely responsible for America ’s cleaner air and water in recent decades ."	"0"
" 4582 . When a city or state government sets up a marketable permit program ( e.g. cap - and - trade ) , it must start by determining the overall quantity of pollution it will allow as it tries to meet national pollution standards ."	"0"
" 4585 . However , it also found that a middle - range estimate of the health and other benefits from cleaner air was $ 22 trillion — about 44 times higher than the costs ."	"0"
" A more recent study by the EPA estimated that the environmental benefits to Americans from the Clean Air Act will exceed their costs by a margin of four to one ."	"0"
" The EPA estimated that “ in 2010 the benefits of Clean Air Act programs will total about $ 110 billion ."	"0"
" 4588 . However , as the extent of environmental protection increases , the cheap and easy ways of reducing pollution begin to decrease , and more costly methods must be used ."	"0"
" The marginal cost curve rises ."	"0"
" Also , as environmental protection increases , the largest marginal benefits are achieved first , followed by reduced marginal benefits ."	"0"
" 4591 . However , low - income countries , with some understandable exasperation , point out that high - income countries do not have much moral standing to lecture them on the necessities of putting environmental protection ahead of economic growth ."	"0"
" After all , high - income countries have historically been the primary contributors to greenhouse warming by burning fossil fuels — and still are today ."	"0"
" It is hard to tell people who are living in a low - income country , where adequate diet , health care , and education are lacking , that they should sacrifice an improved quality of life for a cleaner environment ."	"0"
" 4594 . Depending on their different income levels and political preferences , countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency — that is , the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier ."	"1"
" However , all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency — that is , the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it ."	"0"
" 4597 . In certain cases , however , competition can discourage new technology , especially when other firms can quickly copy a new idea ."	"0"
" Consider a pharmaceutical firm deciding to develop a new drug ."	"0"
" 4600 . However , when a firm invests in new technology , the private benefits , or profits , that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits ."	"0"
" The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology ."	"1"
" As you learned in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities , positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party , or parties . Consider the example of the Big Drug Company , which is planning its R&D budget for the next year ."	"1"
" 4603 . Data in [ link ] , from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ Usual Weekly Earnings of Wage and Salary Workers , Third Quarter 2014 , demonstrate that median weekly earnings are higher for workers who have completed more education ."	"0"
" While these rates of return will beat equivalent investments in Treasury bonds or savings accounts , the estimated returns to education go primarily to the individual worker , so these returns are private rates of return to education ."	"0"

" 4606 . One way to increase new technology is to guarantee the innovator an exclusive right to that new product or process ."	"0"
" Intellectual property rights include patents , which give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time , and copyright laws , which give the author an exclusive legal right over works of literature , music , film / video , and pictures ."	"1"
" For example , if a pharmaceutical firm has a patent on a new drug , then no other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for twenty - one years , unless the firm with the patent grants permission ."	"0"
" 4609 . For example , United for Medical Research , a coalition of groups that seek funding for the National Institutes of Health , ( which is supported by federal grants ) , states : “ NIH - supported research added $ 69 billion to our GDP and supported seven million jobs in 2011 alone . ”"	"1"
