" When we do this , we are relying on a number of monocular cues , or cues that require only one eye ."	"1"
" If you think you ca n’t see depth with one eye , note that you do n’t bump into things when using only one eye while walking — and , in fact , we have more monocular cues than binocular cues ."	"0"

" The outer ear includes the pinna , which is the visible part of the ear that protrudes from our heads , the auditory canal , and the tympanic membrane , or eardrum ."	"1"
" The middle ear contains three tiny bones known as the ossicles , which are named the malleus ( or hammer ) , incus ( or anvil ) , and the stapes ( or stirrup ) ."	"1"
" The inner ear contains the semi - circular canals , which are involved in balance and movement ( the vestibular sense ) , and the cochlea ."	"1"
" 3623 . As the stapes presses into the oval window , the fluid inside the cochlea begins to move , which in turn stimulates hair cells , which are auditory receptor cells of the inner ear embedded in the basilar membrane ."	"0"
" The basilar membrane is a thin strip of tissue within the cochlea ."	"1"
" 3626 . The ability to locate sound in our environments is an important part of hearing ."	"0"
" Localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields ."	"0"
" 3629 . Interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes through your head ."	"1"
" Interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given sound wave arrives at each ear ( [ link ] ) ."	"1"

" 3635 . One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease ."	"0"
" Although not well understood , Ménière 's disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss , tinnitus ( constant ringing or buzzing ) , vertigo ( a sense of spinning ) , and an increase in pressure within the inner ear ( Semaan & Megerian , 2011 ) ."	"1"
" This kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids , but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option ."	"0"

" 3653 . Wertheimer , and his assistants Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka , who later became his partners , believed that perception involved more than simply combining sensory stimuli ."	"1"
" This belief led to a new movement within the field of psychology known as Gestalt psychology ."	"0"
" The word gestalt literally means form or pattern , but its use reflects the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts ."	"0"
" 3656 . We might also use the principle of similarity to group things in our visual fields ."	"0"
" According to this principle , things that are alike tend to be grouped together ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" 3659 . According to Gestalt theorists , pattern perception , or our ability to discriminate among different figures and shapes , occurs by following the principles described above ."	"0"
" You probably feel fairly certain that your perception accurately matches the real world , but this is not always the case ."	"0"
" 3662 . Built from sensations , but influenced by our own experiences , biases , prejudices , and cultures , perceptions can be very different from person to person ."	"0"
" Research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception ."	"0"
" For instance , several studies have demonstrated that non - Black participants identify weapons faster and are more likely to identify non - weapons as weapons when the image of the weapon is paired with the image of a Black person ( Payne , 2001 ; Payne , Shimizu , & Jacoby , 2005 ) ."	"0"
" 3665 . Learning , like reflexes and instincts , allows an organism to adapt to its environment ."	"0"

" In contrast to the innate behaviors discussed above , learning involves acquiring knowledge and skills through experience ."	"0"
" 3668 . Pavlov ( 1849 – 1936 ) , a Russian scientist , performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical conditioning ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" As we discussed briefly in the previous section , classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and , consequently , to anticipate events ."	"0"
" Ivan Pavlov ’s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning ."	"0"
" 3671 . The meat powder in this situation was an unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) : a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an organism ."	"1"
" The dogs ’ salivation was an unconditioned response ( UCR ) : a natural ( unlearned ) reaction to a given stimulus ."	"1"
" Before conditioning , think of the dogs ’ stimulus and response like this :"	"0"
" 3674 . Eventually , the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone , just as they previously had salivated at the sound of the assistants ’ footsteps ."	"0"
" The behavior caused by the conditioned stimulus is called the conditioned response ( CR ) ."	"1"
" In the case of Pavlov ’s dogs , they had learned to associate the tone ( CS ) with being fed , and they began to salivate ( CR ) in anticipation of food ."	"0"
" 3677 . Taste aversion is a type of conditioning in which an interval of several hours may pass between the conditioned stimulus ( something ingested ) and the unconditioned stimulus ( nausea or illness ) ."	"1"
" Here ’s how it works ."	"0"
" 3680 . Animals ( including humans ) need to distinguish between stimuli — for example , between sounds that predict a threatening event and sounds that do not — so that they can respond appropriately ( such as running away if the sound is threatening ) ."	"0"
" When an organism learns to respond differently to various stimuli that are similar , it is called stimulus discrimination ."	"1"
" In classical conditioning terms , the organism demonstrates the conditioned response only to the conditioned stimulus ."	"0"
" 3683 . John B. Watson , shown in [ link ] , is considered the founder of behaviorism ."	"0"
" Behaviorism is a school of thought that arose during the first part of the 20th century , which incorporates elements of Pavlov ’s classical conditioning ( Hunt , 2007 ) ."	"1"
" 3686 . Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the behavior : the reinforcements and punishments ."	"0"
" His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect , which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike ."	"0"
" According to the law of effect , behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated , and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated ( Thorndike , 1911 ) ."	"1"
" 3689 . In negative reinforcement , an undesirable stimulus is removed to increase a behavior ."	"1"
" For example , car manufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems , which go “ beep , beep , beep ” until you fasten your seatbelt ."	"0"
" 3692 . In this case , a stimulus ( the reprimand ) is added in order to decrease the behavior ( texting in class ) ."	"0"
" In negative punishment , you remove a pleasant stimulus to decrease behavior ."	"1"
" For example , when a child misbehaves , a parent can take away a favorite toy ."	"0"
" 3695 . A secondary reinforcer has no inherent value and only has reinforcing qualities when linked with a primary reinforcer ."	"1"
" Praise , linked to affection , is one example of a secondary reinforcer , as when you called out “ Great shot ! ” every time Joaquin made a goal ."	"0"
" 3698 . Now let ’s combine these four terms ."	"0"
" A fixed interval reinforcement schedule is when behavior is rewarded after a set amount of time ."	"1"

" This is the most powerful partial reinforcement schedule ."	"0"
" 3704 . As soon as the rats became aware of the food , they were able to find their way through the maze quickly , just as quickly as the comparison group , which had been rewarded with food all along ."	"0"
" This is known as latent learning : learning that occurs but is not observable in behavior until there is a reason to demonstrate it . Psychologist Edward Tolman found that rats use cognitive maps to navigate through a maze ."	"1"

" 3707 . Imitation is much more obvious in humans , but is imitation really the sincerest form of flattery ?"	"0"
" Consider Claire ’s experience with observational learning ."	"0"
" 3710 . On the other hand , if you observed the model being punished , you would be less motivated to copy her ."	"1"
" This is called vicarious punishment ."	"0"
" For example , imagine that four - year - old Allison watched her older sister Kaitlyn playing in their mother ’s makeup , and then saw Kaitlyn get a time out when their mother came in ."	"0"
" 3713 . Cognitive psychology is the field of psychology dedicated to examining how people think ."	"1"
" It attempts to explain how and why we think the way we do by studying the interactions among human thinking , emotion , creativity , language , and problem solving , in addition to other cognitive processes ."	"0"
" 3716 . In psychology , concepts can be divided into two categories , natural and artificial ."	"0"
" Natural concepts are created “ naturally ” through your experiences and can be developed from either direct or indirect experiences ."	"1"

" 3725 . A phoneme ( e.g. , the sounds “ ah ” vs. “ eh ” ) is a basic sound unit of a given language , and different languages have different sets of phonemes ."	"1"
" Phonemes are combined to form morphemes , which are the smallest units of language that convey some type of meaning ( e.g. , “ I ” is both a phoneme and a morpheme ) ."	"1"
" We use semantics and syntax to construct language ."	"0"
" 3728 . However , young children master language very quickly with relative ease ."	"0"

" You can think of these as mental shortcuts that are used to solve problems ."	"0"
" 3737 . Functional fixedness is a type of mental set where you can not perceive an object being used for something other than what it was designed for ."	"1"
" During the Apollo 13 mission to the moon , NASA engineers at Mission Control had to overcome functional fixedness to save the lives of the astronauts aboard the spacecraft ."	"0"
" 3740 . For example , if you think that your professor is not very nice , you notice all of the instances of rude behavior exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis ."	"0"
" Hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable , even though it really was n’t ."	"1"
" In other words , you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did ."	"0"
" Representative bias describes a faulty way of thinking , in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something ; for example , you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation , because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors ."
