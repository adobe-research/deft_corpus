" Each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns , which supply the renal lobes ."	"0"
" The interlobar arteries split at the junction of the renal cortex and medulla to form the arcuate arteries ."	"0"
" 1801 . Each kidney is made up of over one million nephrons that dot the renal cortex , giving it a granular appearance when sectioned sagittally ."	"0"
" There are two types of nephrons — cortical nephrons ( 85 percent ) , which are deep in the renal cortex , and juxtamedullary nephrons ( 15 percent ) , which lie in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla ."	"0"
" A nephron consists of three parts — a renal corpuscle , a renal tubule , and the associated capillary network , which originates from the cortical radiate arteries ."	"0"
" 1804 . The renal tubule is a long and convoluted structure that emerges from the glomerulus and can be divided into three parts based on function ."	"1"
" The first part is called the proximal convoluted tubule ( PCT ) due to its proximity to the glomerulus ; it stays in the renal cortex ."	"0"
" The second part is called the loop of Henle , or nephritic loop , because it forms a loop ( with descending and ascending limbs ) that goes through the renal medulla ."	"0"
" 1807 . The capillary network that originates from the renal arteries supplies the nephron with blood that needs to be filtered ."	"0"
" The branch that enters the glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole ."	"1"
" The branch that exits the glomerulus is called the efferent arteriole ."	"1"
" 1810 . In cortical nephrons , the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT ."	"1"
" In juxtamedullary nephrons , the peritubular capillary network forms a network around the loop of Henle and is called the vasa recta ."	"0"
" 1813 . Water is also reabsorbed during this step ."	"0"
" Then , additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion , which is , in essence , the opposite process to tubular reabsorption ."	"0"
" The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae ."	"0"
" 1816 . The osmotic gradient increases as it moves deeper into the medulla ."	"0"
" Because two sides of the loop of Henle perform opposing functions , as illustrated in [ link ] , it acts as a countercurrent multiplier ."	"0"
" The vasa recta around it acts as the countercurrent exchanger ."	"0"
