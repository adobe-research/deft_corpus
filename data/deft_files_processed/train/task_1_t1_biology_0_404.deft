" Taste , also called gustation , and smell , also called olfaction , are the most interconnected senses in that both involve molecules of the stimulus entering the body and bonding to receptors ."	"1"
" Smell lets an animal sense the presence of food or other animals — whether potential mates , predators , or prey — or other chemicals in the environment that can impact their survival ."	"0"
" 1481 . Odorants ( odor molecules ) enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium , the mucosa at the back of the nasal cavity ( as illustrated in [ link ] ) ."	"1"
" The olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back of the nasal cavity that spans an area about 5 cm2 in humans ."	"1"
" Recall that sensory cells are neurons ."	"0"
" 1484 . PheromonesA pheromone is a chemical released by an animal that affects the behavior or physiology of animals of the same species ."	"1"
" Pheromonal signals can have profound effects on animals that inhale them , but pheromones apparently are not consciously perceived in the same way as other odors ."	"0"
" 1487 . Olfactory neurons project from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb as thin , unmyelinated axons ."	"1"
" The olfactory bulb is composed of neural clusters called glomeruli , and each glomerulus receives signals from one type of olfactory receptor , so each glomerulus is specific to one odorant ."	"1"
" From glomeruli , olfactory signals travel directly to the olfactory cortex and then to the frontal cortex and the thalamus ."	"0"
" 1490 . The amino acid - derived hormones are relatively small molecules that are derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan , shown in [ link ] ."	"1"
" If a hormone is amino acid - derived , its chemical name will end in “ -ine ” ."	"0"
" 1493 . Additionally , the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change over time , resulting in increased or decreased cell sensitivity ."	"0"
" In up - regulation , the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels , making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity ."	"1"
" When the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels , called down - regulation , cellular activity is reduced ."	"1"
" 1496 . Amino acid derived hormones and polypeptide hormones are not lipid - derived ( lipid - soluble ) and therefore can not diffuse through the plasma membrane of cells ."	"0"
" Lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the outer surface of the plasma membrane , via plasma membrane hormone receptors ."	"1"
" Unlike steroid hormones , lipid insoluble hormones do not directly affect the target cell because they can not enter the cell and act directly on DNA ."	"0"
" 1499 . When a hormone binds to the receptor , the G - protein is activated by binding guanosine triphosphate , or GTP , in place of GDP ."	"0"
" After binding , GTP is hydrolysed by the G - protein into GDP and becomes inactive . The activated G - protein in turn activates a membrane - bound enzyme called adenylyl cyclase ."	"0"
" Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP ."	"1"
" 1502 . Hormonal stimuli refers to the release of a hormone in response to another hormone ."	"1"
" A number of endocrine glands release hormones when stimulated by hormones released by other endocrine glands ."	"0"
" 1505 . It synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary gland ."	"0"
" The hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control . The pituitary gland , sometimes called the hypophysis or “ master gland ” is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica , a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull , illustrated in [ link ] ."

The pituitary gland , sometimes called the hypophysis or “ master gland ” is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica , a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull , illustrated in [ link ] ."	"1"
" It is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk ( or infundibulum ) ."	"0"
" 1508 . The anterior pituitary gland , or adenohypophysis , is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus , down along the infundibulum , and to the anterior pituitary ."	"1"
" This capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system ."	"1"
" A portal system carries blood from one capillary network to another ; therefore , the hypophyseal portal system allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus to be carried directly to the anterior pituitary without first entering the circulatory system . The anterior pituitary produces seven hormones : growth hormone ( GH ) , prolactin ( PRL ) , thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , melanin - stimulating hormone ( MSH ) , adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) ."

" 1511 . The thyroid gland is located in the neck , just below the larynx and in front of the trachea , as shown in [ link ] ."	"1"
" It is a butterfly - shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus ."	"0"
" It has a dark red color due to its extensive vascular system ."	"0"
" 1514 . Most people have four parathyroid glands ; however , the number can vary from two to six ."	"0"
" These glands are located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland , as shown in [ link ] ."	"1"
