" Xylem is the tissue responsible for the storage and long - distance transport of water and nutrients , as well as the transfer of water - soluble growth factors from the organs of synthesis to the target organs ."	"1"
" The tissue consists of conducting cells , known as tracheids , and supportive filler tissue , called parenchyma ."	"1"
" 889 . The existence of two types of morphology suggests that leaves evolved independently in several groups of plants ."	"0"
" The first type of leaf is the microphyll , or “ little leaf , ” which can be dated to 350 million years ago in the late Silurian ."	"0"
" A microphyll is small and has a simple vascular system ."	"1"
" 892 . In addition to photosynthesis , leaves play another role in the life of the plants ."	"0"
" Pine cones , mature fronds of ferns , and flowers are all sporophylls — leaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia ."	"1"
" Strobili are cone - like structures that contain sporangia ."	"1"
" 895 . Phylum Monilophyta : Class Equisetopsida ( Horsetails )"	"0"
" Horsetails , whisk ferns and ferns belong to the phylum Monilophyta , with horsetails placed in the Class Equisetopsida ."	"0"
" The single genus Equisetum is the survivor of a large group of plants , known as Arthrophyta , which produced large trees and entire swamp forests in the Carboniferous ."	"1"
" 898 . The stem may be buried underground as a rhizome , from which adventitious roots grow to absorb water and nutrients from the soil ; or , they may grow above ground as a trunk in tree ferns ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" Adventitious organs are those that grow in unusual places , such as roots growing from the side of a stem ."	"1"
" 901 . Sporophylls are specialized leaves that produce sporangia ."	"1"
" The term strobilus ( plural = strobili ) describes a tight arrangement of sporophylls around a central stalk , as seen in cones ."	"1"
" Some seeds are enveloped by sporophyte tissues upon maturation ."	"0"
" 904 . Like all gymnosperms , pines are heterosporous and generate two different types of spores : male microspores and female megaspores ."	"0"
" In the male cones , or staminate cones , the microsporocytes give rise to pollen grains by meiosis ."	"0"
" In the spring , large amounts of yellow pollen are released and carried by the wind ."	"0"
" 907 . Conifers are the dominant phylum of gymnosperms , with the most variety of species ( [ link ] ) ."	"1"
" Most are typically tall trees that usually bear scale - like or needle - like leaves ."	"0"
