" 1806 . The second part is called the loop of Henle , or nephritic loop , because it forms a loop ( with descending and ascending limbs ) that goes through the renal medulla ."	"1"
" The third part of the renal tubule is called the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT ) and this part is also restricted to the renal cortex ."	"0"
" The DCT , which is the last part of the nephron , connects and empties its contents into collecting ducts that line the medullary pyramids ."	"1"
" 1809 . Within the glomerulus , the network of capillaries is called the glomerular capillary bed ."	"1"
" Once the efferent arteriole exits the glomerulus , it forms the peritubular capillary network , which surrounds and interacts with parts of the renal tubule ."	"0"
" In cortical nephrons , the peritubular capillary network surrounds the PCT and DCT ."	"0"
" 1812 . Second , the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules ."	"0"
" Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process called tubular reabsorption ."	"1"
" In the loop of Henle , the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network ."	"0"
" 1815 . This occurs due to the low blood pressure and high osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries ."	"0"
" However , every solute has a transport maximum and the excess is not reabsorbed . In the loop of Henle , the permeability of the membrane changes ."	"0"
" The descending limb is permeable to water , not solutes ; the opposite is true for the ascending limb ."	"0"
