" 5243 . There are different types of economic integration across the globe , ranging from free trade agreements , in which participants allow each other ’s imports without tariffs or quotas , to common markets , in which participants have a common external trade policy as well as free trade within the group , to full economic unions , in which , in addition to a common market , monetary and fiscal policies are coordinated ."

" 5249 . To a mathematician or an economist , a variable is the name given to a quantity that may assume a range of values ."	"1"
" In the equation of a line presented above , x and y are the variables , with x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis , and b and m representing factors that determine the shape of the line ."	"0"
" 5252 . A negative slope means that two variables are negatively related ; that is , when x increases , y decreases , or when x decreases , y increases ."	"1"

" 5261 . For example , points A and B sit on the same indifference curve Um , which means that they provide Lilly with the same level of utility ."	"0"
" Thus , the marginal utility that Lilly would gain from , say , increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from 120 to 84—so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points A and B ."	"0"
" Indeed , the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the marginal rate of substitution , which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same ."	"1"
" 5264 . This information provides the basis for the budget line shown in [ link ] ."	"0"

" The income effect refers to how a change in the price of a good alters the effective buying power of one ’s income ."	"1"

" 5276 . The final ingredient of the Keynesian cross or expenditure - output diagram is the aggregate expenditure schedule , which will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real GDP ."	"1"
" The intersection of the aggregate expenditure line with the 45-degree line — at point E0 in [ link ] — will show the equilibrium for the economy , because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real GDP ."	"0"
" 5279 . ( Exactly how a situation of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important , because even low - income societies are not literally at zero income , so the point is hypothetical . )"	"0"
" This relationship between income and consumption , illustrated in [ link ] and [ link ] , is called the consumption function ."	"1"
" 5282 . All the components of aggregate demand — consumption , investment , government spending , and the trade balance — are now in place to build the Keynesian cross diagram ."	"0"
" [ link ] builds up an aggregate expenditure function , based on the numerical illustrations of C , I , G , X , and M that have been used throughout this text ."	"0"
" 5285 . The meaning of “ equilibrium ” remains the same ; that is , equilibrium is a point of balance where no incentive exists to shift away from that outcome ."	"1"
" To understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is a macroeconomic equilibrium , consider what would happen if an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point E , say point H in [ link ] , where output is higher than the equilibrium ."	"0"
" 5288 . In this way , the original change in aggregate expenditures is actually spent more than once ."	"0"
" This is called the multiplier effect : An initial increase in spending , cycles repeatedly through the economy and has a larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent ."	"1"
" 5291 . The equilibrium price is $ 80 and the equilibrium quantity is 28 million ."	"0"
" To see the benefits to consumers , look at the segment of the demand curve above the equilibrium point and to the left ."	"0"

" 5294 . The amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller ’s actual cost is called producer surplus ."	"1"
" In [ link ] , producer surplus is the area labeled G — that is , the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium ."	"0"
" The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus , also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus ."	"1"
" In [ link ] , social surplus would be shown as the area F + G ."	"0"
" Social surplus is larger at equilibrium quantity and price than it would be at any other quantity ."	"0"
" 5297 . The new consumer surplus is G , and the new producer surplus is H + I ."	"0"
" In effect , the price floor causes the area H to be transferred from consumer to producer surplus , but also causes a deadweight loss of J + K ."	"0"
