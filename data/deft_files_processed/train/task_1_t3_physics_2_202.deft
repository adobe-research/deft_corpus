" Feynman was one of the theorists who developed the field of quantum electrodynamics ( QED ) , which is the quantum mechanics of electromagnetism ."	"1"

" Theorists quickly proposed two more quark flavors called top ( t ) or truth and bottom ( b ) or beauty to keep the number of quarks the same as the number of leptons ."	"0"

" 3266 . It is beyond the scope of this text to go into more detail on the types of quark and gluon interactions that underlie the observable particles , but the theory ( quantum chromodynamics or QCD ) is very self - consistent ."	"0"
" So successful have QCD and the electroweak theory been that , taken together , they are called the Standard Model ."	"1"
" 3269 . Even more extreme are the energies and distances at which gravity is thought to unify with the other forces in a TOE ."	"0"
" Most speculative and least constrained by experiment are TOEs , one of which is called Superstring theory ."	"0"
" Superstrings are entities that are 10 − 35 m 10 − 35 m size 12 { "" 10 "" rSup { size 8 { - "" 35 "" } } ` m } { } in scale and act like one - dimensional oscillating strings and are also proposed to underlie all particles , forces , and space itself ."	"1"
" At the energy of GUTs , the carrier particles of the weak force would become massless and identical to gluons ."	"0"
" 3272 . He then found that all but the closest galaxies have a red shift in their hydrogen spectra that is proportional to their distance ."	"0"
" The explanation is that there is a cosmological red shift due to the expansion of space itself ."	"0"
" The photon wavelength is stretched in transit from the source to the observer ."	"0"
" 3278 . Many aspects of general relativity have been verified experimentally , some of which are better than science fiction in that they are bizarre but true ."	"0"
" Quantum gravity is the theory that deals with particle exchange of gravitons as the mechanism for the force , and with extreme conditions where quantum mechanics and general relativity must both be used ."	"1"
" A good theory of quantum gravity does not yet exist , but one will be needed to understand how all four forces may be unified ."	"0"
" 3281 . Black holesBlack holes are objects having such large gravitational fields that things can fall in , but nothing , not even light , can escape ."	"1"
" Bodies , like the Earth or the Sun , have what is called an escape velocity ."	"0"
" If an object moves straight up from the body , starting at the escape velocity , it will just be able to escape the gravity of the body ."	"1"
" The greater the acceleration of gravity on the body , the greater is the escape velocity ."	"0"
" 3284 . Supporting this is the fact that very distant galaxies are more likely to have abnormally energetic cores ."	"0"
" Some of the moderately distant galaxies , and hence among the younger , are known as quasars and emit as much or more energy than a normal galaxy but from a region less than a light year across ."	"1"
" Quasar energy outputs may vary in times less than a year , so that the energy - emitting region must be less than a light year across ."	"0"
" 3287 . The motion of stars in galaxies and the motion of galaxies in clusters imply that there is about 10 times as much mass as in the luminous objects we can see ."	"0"
" The indirectly observed non - luminous matter is called dark matter ."	"1"

" 3290 . This means that you can in principle travel an unlimited distance in any direction ."	"0"
" A universe that is closed is called positively curved ."	"1"
" This means that if you travel far enough in any direction , you will return to your starting point , analogous to circumnavigating the Earth ."	"0"
" 3293 . Searches for dark matter in this form are particularly interested in galactic halos because of the huge amount of mass that seems to be there ."	"0"
" Such microlensing objects are thus called massive compact halo objects , or MACHOs ."	"0"
" To date , a few MACHOs have been observed , but not predominantly in galactic halos , nor in the numbers needed to explain dark matter ."	"0"
" 3296 . These are called weakly interacting massive particles , or WIMPs , and would also be chargeless , thus interacting negligibly with normal matter , except through gravitation ."	"0"
" One proposed group of WIMPs would have masses several orders of magnitude greater than nucleons and are sometimes called neutralinos ."	"1"

" This superposition forms a disturbance called a sonic boom , a constructive interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound ."	"1"
" Inside the cone , the interference is mostly destructive , and so the sound intensity there is much less than on the shock wave ."	"0"

" Radiation caused by a magnetic field accelerating a charged particle perpendicular to its velocity is called synchrotron radiation in honor of its importance in these machines ."	"1"
