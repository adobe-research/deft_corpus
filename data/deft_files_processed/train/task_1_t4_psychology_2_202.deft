" 3926 . This approach asks , “ What is normal development ? ” In the early decades of the 20th century , normative psychologists studied large numbers of children at various ages to determine norms ( i.e. , average ages ) of when most children reach specific developmental milestones in each of the three domains ( Gesell , 1933 , 1939 , 1940 ; Gesell & Ilg , 1946 ; Hall , 1904 ) ."

" 3935 . Freud viewed development as discontinuous ; he believed that each of us must pass through a series of stages during childhood , and that if we lack proper nurturance and parenting during a stage , we may become stuck , or fixated , in that stage ."	"0"
" Freud ’s stages are called the stages of psychosexual development ."	"0"
" According to Freud , children ’s pleasure - seeking urges are focused on a different area of the body , called an erogenous zone , at each of the five stages of development : oral , anal , phallic , latency , and genital . While most of Freud ’s ideas have not found support in modern research , we can not discount the contributions that Freud has made to the field of psychology ."	"1"

" 3956 . Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by our immediate environment and surroundings ."	"1"
" In contrast , dispositionism holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors ( Heider , 1958 ) ."	"1"
" An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes personality traits and temperament ."	"1"
" 3962 . When you do well at a task , for example acing an exam , it is in your best interest to make a dispositional attribution for your behavior ( “ I ’m smart , ” ) instead of a situational one ( “ The exam was easy , ” ) ."	"0"
" The tendency of an individual to take credit by making dispositional or internal attributions for positive outcomes but situational or external attributions for negative outcomes is known as the self - serving bias ( Miller & Ross , 1975 ) ."	"1"

" 4043 . Sometimes people will act on their prejudiced attitudes toward a group of people , and this behavior is known as discrimination ."	"0"
" Discrimination is negative action toward an individual as a result of one ’s membership in a particular group ( Allport , 1954 ; Dovidio & Gaertner , 2004 ) ."	"1"
" As a result of holding negative beliefs ( stereotypes ) and negative attitudes ( prejudice ) about a particular group , people often treat the target of prejudice poorly , such as excluding older adults from their circle of friends ."	"0"

" In the job interview example , the employer may not have noticed that the job applicant was friendly and engaging , and that he provided competent responses to the interview questions in the beginning of the interview ."	"0"
" 4055 . Because we often feel a strong sense of belonging and emotional connection to our in - groups , we develop in - group bias : a preference for our own group over other groups ."	"1"
" This in - group bias can result in prejudice and discrimination because the out - group is perceived as different and is less preferred than our in - group ."	"0"
" 4058 . Aggression takes two forms depending on one ’s motives : hostile or instrumental ."	"0"
" Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of anger with intent to cause pain ; a fight in a bar with a stranger is an example of hostile aggression ."	"1"
" In contrast , instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not necessarily involve intent to cause pain ( Berkowitz , 1993 ) ; a contract killer who murders for hire displays instrumental aggression ."	"1"
" 4061 . One form of negative social interactions among children that has become a national concern is bullying ."	"0"

" Procedural justice refers to the fairness of the processes by which outcomes are determined in conflicts with or among employees ."	"1"
" 4106 . The term stress as it relates to the human condition first emerged in scientific literature in the 1930s , but it did not enter the popular vernacular until the 1970s ( Lyon , 2012 ) ."	"0"
" Today , we often use the term loosely in describing a variety of unpleasant feeling states ; for example , we often say we are stressed out when we feel frustrated , angry , conflicted , overwhelmed , or fatigued ."	"0"
" 4109 . A useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well - being ( Lazarus & Folkman , 1984 ) ."	"0"
" A critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise — that is , judge — demanding or threatening events ( often referred to as stressors ) ; these appraisals , in turn , influence our reactions to such events ."	"1"
" Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard : primary and secondary appraisals ."	"0"
" 4112 . He argued that stress can sometimes be a positive , motivating force that can improve the quality of our lives ."	"0"
" This kind of stress , which Selye called eustress ( from the Greek eu = “ good ” ) , is a good kind of stress associated with positive feelings , optimal health , and performance ."	"1"
" A moderate amount of stress can be beneficial in challenging situations ."	"0"
" 4115 . As previously stated , scientific interest in stress goes back nearly a century ."	"0"
" One of the early pioneers in the study of stress was Walter Cannon , an eminent American physiologist at Harvard Medical School ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" In the early part of the 20th century , Cannon was the first to identify the body ’s physiological reactions to stress ."	"0"
" 4118 . These physiological reactions were nonspecific , which means that regardless of the type of stressor , the same pattern of reactions would occur ."	"0"
" What Selye discovered was the general adaptation syndrome , the body ’s nonspecific physiological response to stress ."	"1"
" 4121 . If exposure to a stressor continues over a longer period of time , the stage of exhaustion ensues ."	"0"
" At this stage , the person is no longer able to adapt to the stressor : the body ’s ability to resist becomes depleted as physical wear takes its toll on the body ’s tissues and organs ."	"1"
" 4124 . In short bursts , this process can have some favorable effects , such as providing extra energy , improving immune system functioning temporarily , and decreasing pain sensitivity ."	"0"
" However , extended release of cortisol — as would happen with prolonged or chronic stress — often comes at a high price ."	"0"
" 4127 . For an individual to experience stress , he must first encounter a potential stressor ."	"0"
" In general , stressors can be placed into one of two broad categories : chronic and acute ."	"0"
" 4130 . The Holmes and Rahe Social Readjustment Rating Scale ( SRRS ) uses the correlational research method to identify the connection between stress and health ."	"1"
" That is , respondents ’ LCU scores are correlated with the number or frequency of self - reported symptoms indicating health problems ."	"0"
" 4133 . Some people who are exposed to chronically stressful work conditions can experience job burnout , which is a general sense of emotional exhaustion and cynicism in relation to one ’s job ( Maslach & Jackson , 1981 ) ."	"1"

" Behavior therapies are used to treat comorbid conditions , and in many cases , psychotropic medications are used along with psychotherapy ."	"0"
" 4139 . In a sense , the immune system is the body ’s surveillance system ."	"0"
" It consists of a variety of structures , cells , and mechanisms that serve to protect the body from invading toxins and microorganisms that can harm or damage the body ’s tissues and organs ."	"0"
" 4142 . Also , we noted earlier that stress hormones released during hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis activation can adversely impact immune function ."	"0"
" One way they do this is by inhibiting the production of lymphocytes , white blood cells that circulate in the body ’s fluids that are important in the immune response ( Everly & Lating , 2002 ) ."	"1"
" 4145 . A major risk factor for heart disease is hypertension , which is high blood pressure ."	"1"
" Hypertension forces a person ’s heart to pump harder , thus putting more physical strain on the heart ."	"0"
" 4148 . In addition to anger and hostility , a number of other negative emotional states have been linked with heart disease , including negative affectivity and depression ( Suls & Bunde , 2005 ) ."	"0"
" Negative affectivity is a tendency to experience distressed emotional states involving anger , contempt , disgust , guilt , fear , and nervousness ( Watson , Clark , & Tellegen , 1988 ) ."	"1"
" It has been linked with the development of both hypertension and heart disease ."	"0"

" When children are placed in group therapy , it is particularly important to match clients for age and problems ."	"0"
" 4157 . There are several different types of family therapy ."	"0"
" In structural family therapy , the therapist examines and discusses the boundaries and structure of the family : who makes the rules , who sleeps in the bed with whom , how decisions are made , and what are the boundaries within the family ."	"1"
" In some families , the parents do not work together to make rules , or one parent may undermine the other , leading the children to act out ."	"0"

" In dream analysis , a therapist interprets the underlying meaning of dreams ."	"1"
" 4166 . Play therapy is often used with children since they are not likely to sit on a couch and recall their dreams or engage in traditional talk therapy ."	"0"
" This technique uses a therapeutic process of play to “ help clients prevent or resolve psychosocial difficulties and achieve optimal growth ” ( O’Connor , 2000 , p. 7 ) ."	"1"
" 4169 . One commonly used classical conditioning therapeutic technique is counterconditioning : a client learns a new response to a stimulus that has previously elicited an undesirable behavior ."	"1"
" Two counterconditioning techniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy ."	"0"
" 4172 . Thirty years later , Joseph Wolpe ( 1958 ) refined Jones ’s techniques , giving us the behavior therapy technique of exposure therapy that is used today ."	"0"
" A popular form of exposure therapy is systematic desensitization , wherein a calm and pleasant state is gradually associated with increasing levels of anxiety - inducing stimuli ."	"1"
" The idea is that you ca n’t be nervous and relaxed at the same time ."	"0"
" 4175 . Cognitive therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on how a person ’s thoughts lead to feelings of distress ."	"1"
" The idea behind cognitive therapy is that how you think determines how you feel and act ."	"0"
" 4178 . One of the first forms of cognitive - behavioral therapy was rational emotive therapy ( RET ) , which was founded by Albert Ellis and grew out of his dislike of Freudian psychoanalysis ( Daniel , n.d . ) ."	"0"
" Behaviorists such as Joseph Wolpe also influenced Ellis ’s therapeutic approach ( National Association of Cognitive - Behavioral Therapists , 2009 ) ."	"0"
" Cognitive - behavioral therapy ( CBT ) helps clients examine how their thoughts affect their behavior ."	"1"
" It aims to change cognitive distortions and self - defeating behaviors ."	"0"
" 4181 . Rogers ( 1951 ) felt that the term patient suggested the person seeking help was sick and looking for a cure ."	"0"
" Since this is a form of nondirective therapy , a therapeutic approach in which the therapist does not give advice or provide interpretations but helps the person to identify conflicts and understand feelings , Rogers ( 1951 ) emphasized the importance of the person taking control of his own life to overcome life ’s challenges ."

" 4190 . Seligman believed that the dogs who failed to try to escape the later shocks were demonstrating learned helplessness : They had acquired a belief that they were powerless to do anything about the noxious stimulation they were receiving ."	"1"
" Seligman also believed that the passivity and lack of initiative these dogs demonstrated was similar to that observed in human depression ."	"0"
" 4193 . Their review is aimed at determining which coping strategies are most effective at offsetting negative health outcomes associated with racism - related stress ."	"0"
" The authors examine the effectiveness of three coping strategies : focusing on racial identity to handle race - related stress , anger expression / suppression , and seeking social support ."	"0"
" You ’ve learned a bit about social support , so we ’ll focus the remainder of this discussion on the potential coping strategies of focusing on racial identity and anger expression / suppression . Focusing on racial identity refers to the process by which a person comes to feel as if he belongs to a given racial group ; this may increase a sense of pride associated with group membership ."	"0"
" 4196 . In the 1970s , Herbert Benson , a cardiologist , developed a stress reduction method called the relaxation response technique ( Greenberg , 2006 ) ."	"0"
