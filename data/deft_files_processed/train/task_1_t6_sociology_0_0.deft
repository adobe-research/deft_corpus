" That is why sociologists are careful to define their terms ."	"0"
" In a hygiene study , for instance , hygiene could be defined as “ personal habits to maintain physical appearance ( as opposed to health ) , ” and a researcher might ask , “ How do differing personal hygiene habits reflect the cultural value placed on appearance ? ”"	"1"
" When forming these basic research questions , sociologists develop an operational definition , that is , they define the concept in terms of the physical or concrete steps it takes to objectively measure it ."	"1"
" The operational definition identifies an observable condition of the concept ."	"0"
" 5367 . In sociology , the hypothesis will often predict how one form of human behavior influences another ."	"0"

" 5412 . Sociologists distinguish subcultures from countercultures , which are a type of subculture that rejects some of the larger culture ’s norms and values ."	"1"
" In contrast to subcultures , which operate relatively smoothly within the larger society , countercultures might actively defy larger society by developing their own set of rules and norms to live by , sometimes even creating communities that operate outside of greater society ."	"0"
