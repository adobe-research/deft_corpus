The pituitary gland , sometimes called the hypophysis or “ master gland ” is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica , a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull , illustrated in [ link ] ."

" It is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk ( or infundibulum ) ."	"0"
" The anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or release - inhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus , and the posterior pituitary receives signals via neurosecretory cells to release hormones produced by the hypothalamus ."	"0"
" 1509 . The posterior pituitary is significantly different in structure from the anterior pituitary ."	"0"
" It is a part of the brain , extending down from the hypothalamus , and contains mostly nerve fibers and neuroglial cells , which support axons that extend from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary ."	"1"
" 1512 . The thyroid gland is made up of many spherical thyroid follicles , which are lined with a simple cuboidal epithelium ."	"0"
" These follicles contain a viscous fluid , called colloid , which stores the glycoprotein thyroglobulin , the precursor to the thyroid hormones ."	"1"
" The follicles produce hormones that can be stored in the colloid or released into the surrounding capillary network for transport to the rest of the body via the circulatory system ."	"0"
