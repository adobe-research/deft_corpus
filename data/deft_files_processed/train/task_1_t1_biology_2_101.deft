" 435 . Mendel ’s parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait ."	"0"
" When P1 plants with contrasting traits were cross - fertilized , all of the offspring were heterozygous for the contrasting trait , meaning that their genotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined ."	"0"
" 438 . Beyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents , Mendel also developed a way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a homozygote ."	"1"

" 567 . While these changes do n’t occur simultaneously in one cancer , changes at each of these levels can be detected when observing cancer at different sites in different individuals ."	"0"
" Therefore , changes in histone acetylation ( epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing ) , activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation , increased RNA stability , increased translational control , and protein modification can all be detected at some point in various cancer cells ."	"1"
" Scientists are working to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification might be exploited to destroy a tumor cell ."	"0"
" 570 . Most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that are not desired ( such as degradation of unwanted molecules and separation from the DNA sample ) ."	"0"
" Cells are broken using a lysis buffer ( a solution which is mostly a detergent ) ; lysis means “ to split . ” These enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes ."	"1"
" Macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins , and ribonucleases ( RNAses ) that break down RNA ."	"0"
" 573 . DNA fragments can also be amplified from an RNA template in a process called reverse transcriptase PCR ( RT - PCR ) ."	"1"
" The first step is to recreate the original DNA template strand ( called cDNA ) by applying DNA nucleotides to the mRNA ."	"0"
" 576 . The nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences ."	"0"
" When DNA is transferred to a nylon membrane , the technique is called Southern blotting , and when RNA is transferred to a nylon membrane , it is called northern blotting ."	"1"
" Southern blots are used to detect the presence of certain DNA sequences in a given genome , and northern blots are used to detect gene expression ."	"0"
" 579 . Plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large - scale production of important reagents , such as insulin and human growth hormone ."	"1"
" An important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment can be introduced via the multiple cloning site ( MCS ) ."	"0"
" The MCS is a short DNA sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases ."	"1"
" 582 . They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis ."	"0"
" Proteins that are expressed from recombinant DNA molecules are called recombinant proteins ."	"1"
" Not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes ."	"0"
" 585 . Genetic engineering is the alteration of an organism ’s genotype using recombinant DNA technology to modify an organism ’s DNA to achieve desirable traits ."	"1"
" The addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering ."	"0"
" 588 . The methods used to disable gene function are collectively called gene targeting ."	"0"
" Gene targeting is the use of recombinant DNA vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene , either by introducing mutations in a gene , or by eliminating the expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the genome of an organism ."	"1"
" 591 . In nature , the disease - causing A. tumefaciens have a set of plasmids , called the Ti plasmids ( tumor - inducing plasmids ) , that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants ."	"1"
" DNA from the Ti plasmid integrates into the infected plant cell ’s genome ."	"0"
" 594 . The maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets ."	"0"
" A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome ."	"1"
" Genetic maps provide the big picture ( similar to a map of interstate highways ) and use genetic markers ( similar to landmarks ) ."	"0"
" 597 . The study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis , a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency between genes to determine if they are linked or show independent assortment ."	"1"
" The term linkage was used before the discovery of DNA ."	"0"
" 600 . There are three methods used to create a physical map : cytogenetic mapping , radiation hybrid mapping , and sequence mapping ."	"0"
" Cytogenetic mapping uses information obtained by microscopic analysis of stained sections of the chromosome ( [ link ] ) ."	"1"
" It is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping , but not the exact distance ( number of base pairs ) ."	"0"
" 603 . Sequence mapping resulted from DNA sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs ."	"0"
" The creation of genomic libraries and complementary DNA ( cDNA ) libraries ( collections of cloned sequences or all DNA from a genome ) has sped up the process of physical mapping ."	"1"
" A genetic site used to generate a physical map with sequencing technology ( a sequence - tagged site , or STS ) is a unique sequence in the genome with a known exact chromosomal location ."	"1"
