" Price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded ( Qd ) or supplied ( Qs ) and the corresponding percent change in price ."	"1"
" The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price ."	"1"

" Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service ."	"1"

" Kimberly has $ 1,000 per year to spend between these two choices ."	"0"
" 4464 . A choice like P means that a rise in income caused her quantity consumed of overnight stays to decline , while a choice like Q would mean that a rise in income caused her quantity of concerts to decline ."	"0"
" Goods where demand declines as income rises ( or conversely , where the demand rises as income falls ) are called “ inferior goods . ” An inferior good occurs when people trim back on a good as income rises , because they can now afford the more expensive choices that they prefer ."	"1"
