" 49 . To understand how elements come together , we must first discuss the smallest component or building block of an element , the atom ."	"0"
" An atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element ."	"0"
" For example , one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room temperature ."	"0"
" 52 . Therefore , the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass , but not to its charge ."	"0"
" Electrons are much smaller in mass than protons , weighing only 9.11 × 10 - 28 grams , or about 1 / 1800 of an atomic mass unit ."	"0"
" Hence , they do not contribute much to an element ’s overall atomic mass ."	"0"
" 55 . This approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number ."	"0"
" Since an element ’s isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers , scientists also determine the atomic mass , which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes ."	"0"

" As a result of losing a negatively charged electron , they become positively charged ions ."	"0"
" Group 17 elements , including fluorine and chlorine , have seven electrons in their outmost shells , so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules , making them negatively charged ions ."	"0"
" 67 . This is because it is energetically favorable for atoms to be in that configuration and it makes them stable ."	"0"
" However , since not all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells , atoms form chemical bonds with other atoms thereby obtaining the electrons they need to attain a stable electron configuration ."	"0"

" 82 . There are two types of covalent bonds : polar and nonpolar ."	"0"
" In a polar covalent bond , shown in [ link ] , the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other ."	"1"
" Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements , a slightly positive ( δ+ ) or slightly negative ( δ – ) charge develops ."	"0"
" 85 . When this happens , a weak interaction occurs between the δ+of the hydrogen from one molecule and the δ – charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule , usually oxygen or nitrogen , or within the same molecule ."	"1"
" This interaction is called a hydrogen bond ."	"0"
" This type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules ."	"0"

" Structural isomers ( like butane and isobutene shown in [ link ] a ) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds : both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens ( C4H10 ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties ."	"1"
" For example , due to their different chemical properties , butane is suited for use as a fuel for cigarette lighters and torches , whereas isobutene is suited for use as a refrigerant and a propellant in spray cans ."	"0"

" Both structures are the α - helix structure — the helix held in shape by hydrogen bonds ."	"1"
" 148 . It was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process ."	"0"
" Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers known as chaperones ( or chaperonins ) that associate with the target protein during the folding process ."	"1"

" Unlike prokaryotic cells , eukaryotic cells have : 1 ) a membrane - bound nucleus ; 2 ) numerous membrane - bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum , Golgi apparatus , chloroplasts , mitochondria , and others ; and 3 ) several , rod - shaped chromosomes ."	"1"
" Because a eukaryotic cell ’s nucleus is surrounded by a membrane , it is often said to have a “ true nucleus . ” The word “ organelle ” means “ little organ , ” and , as already mentioned , organelles have specialized cellular functions , just as the organs of your body have specialized functions ."

" 262 . In some cases of enzyme inhibition , for example , an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the active site and simply block the substrate from binding ."	"0"

" 274 . The other mechanism uses a group of integral proteins called GLUT proteins , also known as glucose transporter proteins ."	"0"
" These transporters assist in the facilitated diffusion of glucose . Glycolysis begins with the six carbon ring - shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of a three - carbon sugar called pyruvate ."	"1"
" Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases ."	"0"
" 277 . There , pyruvate will be transformed into an acetyl group that will be picked up and activated by a carrier compound called coenzyme A ( CoA ) ."	"0"
" The resulting compound is called acetyl CoA ."	"0"
" CoA is made from vitamin B5 , pantothenic acid ."	"0"
" 280 . The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( [ link ] ) is a series of interconnected membranous sacs and tubules that collectively modifies proteins and synthesizes lipids ."	"1"
" However , these two functions are performed in separate areas of the ER : the rough ER and the smooth ER , respectively ."	"0"
" 283 . Before reaching their final destination , the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles still need to be sorted , packaged , and tagged so that they wind up in the right place ."	"0"
" Sorting , tagging , packaging , and distribution of lipids and proteins takes place in the Golgi apparatus ( also called the Golgi body ) , a series of flattened membranes ( [ link ] ) ."	"1"
" 286 . Some type of control exists at each stage of glucose metabolism ."	"0"
" Access of glucose to the cell can be regulated using the GLUT proteins that transport glucose ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" Different forms of the GLUT protein control passage of glucose into the cells of specific tissues ."	"0"
" 289 . The energy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy captured and stored by photosynthesis almost 200 million years ago . Plants , algae , and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing photosynthesis ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" Because they use light to manufacture their own food , they are called photoautotrophs ( literally , “ self - feeders using light ” ) ."	"1"
" Other organisms , such as animals , fungi , and most other bacteria , are termed heterotrophs ( “ other feeders ” ) , because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs ."	"0"
" 292 . In plants , photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves , which consist of several layers of cells ."	"0"
" The process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll ."	"1"
" The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small , regulated openings called stomata ( singular : stoma ) , which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance ."	"0"
" 295 . Chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope ( composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane ) ."	"0"
" Within the chloroplast are stacked , disc - shaped structures called thylakoids ."	"0"
" Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll , a pigment ( molecule that absorbs light ) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material , and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain ."	"1"
" Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll , a pigment ( molecule that absorbs light ) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material , and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain ."	"1"
" 298 . The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen ."	"0"
" As shown in [ link ] , a stack of thylakoids is called a granum , and the liquid - filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or “ bed ” ( not to be confused with stoma or “ mouth , ” an opening on the leaf epidermis ) ."	"1"

" 301 . Humans can see only a fraction of this energy , which portion is therefore referred to as “ visible light . ”"	"1"
" The manner in which solar energy travels is described as waves ."	"1"
" Scientists can determine the amount of energy of a wave by measuring its wavelength , the distance between consecutive points of a wave ."	"1"
" A single wave is measured from two consecutive points , such as from crest to crest or from trough to trough ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
