" In his book The Division of Labor in Society ( 1893 ) , Durkheim argued that as society grew more complex , social order made the transition from mechanical to organic . Preindustrial societies , Durkheim explained , were held together by mechanical solidarity , a type of social order maintained by the collective consciousness of a culture ."	"0"

" 5489 . Peer GroupsA peer group is made up of people who are similar in age and social status and who share interests ."	"1"
" Peer group socialization begins in the earliest years , such as when kids on a playground teach younger children the norms about taking turns , the rules of a game , or how to shoot a basket ."	"0"
" 5492 . The term group is an amorphous one and can refer to a wide variety of gatherings , from just two people ( think about a “ group project ” in school when you partner with another student ) , a club , a regular gathering of friends , or people who work together or share a hobby ."	"1"

" According to Cooley , primary groups play the most critical role in our lives ."	"0"
" 5498 . The feeling that we belong in an elite or select group is a heady one , while the feeling of not being allowed in , or of being in competition with a group , can be motivating in a different way ."	"0"
" Sociologist William Sumner ( 1840 – 1910 ) developed the concepts of in - group and out - group to explain this phenomenon ( Sumner 1906 ) ."	"0"

" 5501 . After all , how well could soldiers function in a battle if they had no idea whom to listen to or if different people were calling out orders ?"	"0"
" Other secondary groups , like a workplace or a classroom , also have formal leaders , but the styles and functions of leadership can vary significantly . Leadership function refers to the main focus or goal of the leader ."	"1"
" An instrumental leader is one who is goal - oriented and largely concerned with accomplishing set tasks ."	"1"
" 5504 . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's experiences provide an example of the way society reacts to a high - profile woman who is an instrumental leader ."	"0"
" Despite the stereotype , Boatwright and Forrest ( 2000 ) have found that both men and women prefer leaders who use a combination of expressive and instrumental leadership ."	"0"
" In addition to these leadership functions , there are three different leadership styles ."	"0"
" Democratic leaders encourage group participation in all decision making ."	"1"
" 5507 . While this style can work well with highly motivated and mature participants who have clear goals and guidelines , it risks group dissolution and a lack of progress ."	"0"
" As the name suggests , authoritarian leaders issue orders and assigns tasks ."	"1"
" These leaders are clear instrumental leaders with a strong focus on meeting goals ."	"0"
" 5510 . From schools to businesses to healthcare to government , these organizations , referred to as formal organizations , are highly bureaucratized ."	"0"
" Indeed , all formal organizations are , or likely will become , bureaucracies ."	"0"
" A bureaucracy is an ideal type of formal organization ."	"1"
" 5513 . These may include prison or a rehabilitation center ."	"0"
" Symbolic interactionist Erving Goffman states that most coercive organizations are total institutions ( 1961 ) ."	"0"
" A total institution is one in which inmates or military soldiers live a controlled lifestyle and in which total resocialization takes place ."	"1"
" 5516 . A clear division of labor refers to the fact that within a bureaucracy , each individual has a specialized task to perform ."	"1"
" For example , psychology professors teach psychology , but they do not attempt to provide students with financial aid forms ."	"0"
" 5519 . This results in an impersonal organization ."	"0"
" Customers frequently complain that stores like Walmart care little about individuals , other businesses , and the community at large ."	"0"
" Bureaucracies are , in theory at least , meritocracies , meaning that hiring and promotion is based on proven and documented skills , rather than on nepotism or random choice ."	"1"
" In order to get into a prestigious college , you need to perform well on the SAT and have an impressive transcript ."	"0"
" 5522 . And what is the relationship between deviance and crime ?"	"0"
" According to sociologist William Graham Sumner , deviance is a violation of established contextual , cultural , or social norms , whether folkways , mores , or codified law ( 1906 ) ."	"1"
" It can be as minor as picking your nose in public or as major as committing murder ."	"0"
" 5525 . Think of social order as an employee handbook and social control as a manager ."	"0"
" When a worker violates a workplace guideline , the manager steps in to enforce the rules ; when an employee is doing an exceptionally good job at following the rules , the manager may praise or promote the employee ."	"0"
" The means of enforcing rules are known as sanctions ."	"1"
" Sanctions can be positive as well as negative ."	"0"
" 5528 . Although shoplifting , a form of social deviance , may be illegal , there are no laws dictating the proper way to scratch your nose ."	"0"
" That does n’t mean picking your nose in public wo n’t be punished ; instead , you will encounter informal sanctions ."	"0"
" Informal sanctions emerge in face - to - face social interactions ."	"0"
" 5531 . Developed by researchers at the University of Chicago in the 1920s and 1930s , social disorganization theory asserts that crime is most likely to occur in communities with weak social ties and the absence of social control ."	"1"
" An individual who grows up in a poor neighborhood with high rates of drug use , violence , teenage delinquency , and deprived parenting is more likely to become a criminal than an individual from a wealthy neighborhood with a good school system and families who are involved positively in the community ."	"0"
" 5534 . Conflict theory was greatly influenced by the work of German philosopher , economist , and social scientist Karl Marx ."	"0"
" Marx believed that the general population was divided into two groups ."	"0"
" 5537 . Sociologist Edwin Lemert expanded on the concepts of labeling theory and identified two types of deviance that affect identity formation ."	"0"
" Primary deviance is a violation of norms that does not result in any long - term effects on the individual ’s self - image or interactions with others ."	"1"
" Speeding is a deviant act , but receiving a speeding ticket generally does not make others view you as a bad person , nor does it alter your own self - concept ."	"0"
" 5540 . Since criminology was a young field , he drew on other aspects of sociology including social interactions and group learning ( Laub 2006 ) ."	"0"
" His conclusions established differential association theory , which suggested that individuals learn deviant behavior from those close to them who provide models of and opportunities for deviance ."	"1"
" According to Sutherland , deviance is less a personal choice and more a result of differential socialization processes ."	"0"
" 5543 . In modern U.S. society , crimes are classified as one of two types based on their severity ."	"0"
" Violent crimes ( also known as “ crimes against a person ” ) are based on the use of force or the threat of force ."	"1"
" Rape , murder , and armed robbery fall under this category ."	"0"
" 5546 . When we think of crime , we often picture street crime , or offenses committed by ordinary people against other people or organizations , usually in public spaces ."	"1"
" An often overlooked category is corporate crime , or crime committed by white - collar workers in a business environment ."	"1"
" Embezzlement , insider trading , and identity theft are all types of corporate crime ."	"0"
" 5549 . Due to these issues , the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics publishes a separate self - report study known as the National Crime Victimization Report ( NCVR ) ."	"0"
" A self - report study is a collection of data gathered using voluntary response methods , such as questionnaires or telephone interviews ."	"1"

" 5552 . CourtsOnce a crime has been committed and a violator has been identified by the police , the case goes to court ."	"0"
" A court is a system that has the authority to make decisions based on law ."	"1"
" The U.S. judicial system is divided into federal courts and state courts ."	"0"
" 5555 . The first is differential class - based access to technology in the form of the digital divide ."	"0"
" This digital divide has led to the second form , a knowledge gap , which is , as it sounds , an ongoing and increasing gap in information for those who have less access to technology ."	"1"
" Simply put , students in well - funded schools receive more exposure to technology than students in poorly funded schools ."	"0"
" 5558 . According to the functionalist perspective , health is vital to the stability of the society , and therefore sickness is a sanctioned form of deviance ."	"0"
" Talcott Parsons ( 1951 ) was the first to discuss this in terms of the sick role : patterns of expectations that define appropriate behavior for the sick and for those who take care of them ."	"0"
" 5561 . As we discussed in the beginning of the chapter , interactionists focus on the specific meanings and causes people attribute to illness ."	"1"
" The term medicalization of deviance refers to the process that changes “ bad ” behavior into “ sick ” behavior ."	"1"
" A related process is demedicalization , in which “ sick ” behavior is normalized again ."	"1"
" 5564 . Unfortunately , the U.S. Census Current Population Survey of 2013 shows that 18 percent of people in the United States have no health insurance at all ."	"0"
" Equally alarming , a study by the Commonwealth Fund shows that in 2010 , 81 million adults were either uninsured or underinsured ; that is , people who pay at least 10 percent of their income on healthcare costs not covered by insurance or , for low - income adults , those whose medical expenses or deductibles are at least 5 percent of their income ( Schoen , Doty , Robertson , and Collins 2011 ) ."
