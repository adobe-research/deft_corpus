" 0 . What is biology ?"	"0"
" In simple terms , biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with one another and their environments ."	"1"
" This is a very broad definition because the scope of biology is vast ."	"0"
" 3 . The steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later , but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments ."	"0"
" A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event , which can be tested ."	"1"
" Although using the scientific method is inherent to science , it is inadequate in determining what science is ."	"0"
" 6 . For some experts , the natural sciences are astronomy , biology , chemistry , earth science , and physics ."	"0"
" Other scholars choose to divide natural sciences into life sciences , which study living things and include biology , and physical sciences , which study nonliving matter and include astronomy , geology , physics , and chemistry ."	"1"
" Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both life and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary ."	"0"
" 9 . Both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study : descriptive science and hypothesis - based science ."	"0"
" Descriptive ( or discovery ) science , which is usually inductive , aims to observe , explore , and discover , while hypothesis - based science , which is usually deductive , begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested ."	"1"

" The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred , and most scientific endeavors combine both approaches ."	"0"
" 18 . The introduction starts with brief , but broad , background information about what is known in the field ."	"1"
" A good introduction also gives the rationale of the work ; it justifies the work carried out and also briefly mentions the end of the paper , where the hypothesis or research question driving the research will be presented ."	"0"
" 21 . Some journals require a results section followed by a discussion section , but it is more common to combine both ."	"0"
" If the journal does not allow the combination of both sections , the results section simply narrates the findings without any further interpretation ."	"1"

" 27 . Atoms form molecules ."	"0"
" A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds ."	"1"
" Many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules , large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization ( a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers , which are simpler than macromolecules ) ."	"1"
" 30 . Examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts , which carry out indispensable functions : mitochondria produce energy to power the cell , while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugars ."	"0"
" All living things are made of cells ; the cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms ."	"1"

" 51 . Although similar in mass , protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge ."	"0"
" A proton is positively charged whereas a neutron is uncharged ."	"0"
" Therefore , the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass , but not to its charge ."	"0"
" 54 . The number of neutrons is variable , resulting in isotopes , which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess ."	"0"
" Together , the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an element ’s mass number , as illustrated in [ link ] ."	"1"
" Note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number ."	"0"
" 63 . The group 18 atoms helium ( He ) , neon ( Ne ) , and argon ( Ar ) all have filled outer electron shells , making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability ; they are highly stable as single atoms ."	"0"

" Reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction ."	"0"
" 84 . Nonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons equally ."	"1"
" For example , molecular oxygen ( O2 ) is nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between the two oxygen atoms ."	"0"
" 87 . Water also attracts or is attracted to other polar molecules and ions ."	"0"
" A polar substance that interacts readily with or dissolves in water is referred to as hydrophilic ( hydro- = “ water ” ; -philic = “ loving ” ) ."	"1"
" In contrast , non - polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water , as shown in [ link ] and separate from it rather than dissolve in it , as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar ( an acidic water solution ) ."	"0"
" 90 . Specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree Celsius ."	"1"
" For water , this amount is one calorie ."	"0"
" It therefore takes water a long time to heat and long time to cool ."	"0"
" 93 . Since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges , ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it ."	"0"
" Therefore , water is referred to as a solvent , a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds ."	"1"
" The charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water , surrounding the particle with water molecules ."	"0"
" 96 . Cohesion allows for the development of surface tension , the capacity of a substance to withstand being ruptured when placed under tension or stress ."	"1"
" This is also why water forms droplets when placed on a dry surface rather than being flattened out by gravity ."	"0"

" 108 . The three - dimensional placement of atoms and chemical bonds within organic molecules is central to understanding their chemistry ."	"0"
" Molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement ( structure ) of their atoms and/or chemical bonds are known as isomers ."	"1"
" Structural isomers ( like butane and isobutene shown in [ link ] a ) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds : both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens ( C4H10 ) , but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties ."	"1"
" 111 . Enantiomers are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in the three - dimensional placement of atoms so that they are mirror images ."	"1"

" A solution 's tonicity often directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution ."	"0"
" 219 . As for a hypertonic solution , the prefix hyper- refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher osmolarity than the cell ’s cytoplasm ; therefore , the fluid contains less water than the cell does ."	"1"
" Because the cell has a relatively higher concentration of water , water will leave the cell ."	"0"
" 222 . Active transport mechanisms require the use of the cell ’s energy , usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) ."	"1"
" If a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient — that is , if the concentration of the substance inside the cell is greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid ( and vice versa ) — the cell must use energy to move the substance ."	"0"
" 225 . Two mechanisms exist for the transport of small - molecular weight material and small molecules ."	"0"
" Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane , which is directly dependent on ATP ."	"1"
" Secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require ATP ."	"0"
" 228 . An important membrane adaption for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps to facilitate movement : there are three types of these proteins or transporters ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"

" An endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without the addition of free energy ."	"0"
" 255 . The source of the activation energy needed to push reactions forward is typically heat energy from the surroundings ."	"0"
" Heat energy ( the total bond energy of reactants or products in a chemical reaction ) speeds up the motion of molecules , increasing the frequency and force with which they collide ; it also moves atoms and bonds within the molecule slightly , helping them reach their transition state ."	"1"
