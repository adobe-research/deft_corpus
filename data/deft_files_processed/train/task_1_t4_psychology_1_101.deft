" 3621 . The inner ear contains the semi - circular canals , which are involved in balance and movement ( the vestibular sense ) , and the cochlea ."	"0"
" The cochlea is a fluid - filled , snail - shaped structure that contains the sensory receptor cells ( hair cells ) of the auditory system ( [ link ] ) ."	"1"
" 3624 . We ’ll discuss two of them here : temporal theory and place theory ."	"0"
" The temporal theory of pitch perception asserts that frequency is coded by the activity level of a sensory neuron ."	"1"
" This would mean that a given hair cell would fire action potentials related to the frequency of the sound wave ."	"0"
" 3627 . Localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields ."	"0"
" Like the monocular and binocular cues that provided information about depth , the auditory system uses both monaural ( one - eared ) and binaural ( two - eared ) cues to localize sound ."	"1"
" 3630 . Deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear ."	"1"
" Some people are born deaf , which is known as congenital deafness ."	"1"
" 3633 . When the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain , it is called sensorineural hearing loss ."	"1"
" One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière 's disease ."	"0"
" 3636 . This kind of loss can not be treated with hearing aids , but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option ."	"0"
" Cochlear implants are electronic devices that consist of a microphone , a speech processor , and an electrode array ."	"1"
" The device receives incoming sound information and directly stimulates the auditory nerve to transmit information to the brain ."	"0"

" 3663 . Both instincts and reflexes are innate behaviors that organisms are born with ."	"0"
" Reflexes are a motor or neural reaction to a specific stimulus in the environment ."	"1"
" They tend to be simpler than instincts , involve the activity of specific body parts and systems ( e.g. , the knee - jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light ) , and involve more primitive centers of the central nervous system ( e.g. , the spinal cord and the medulla ) ."	"0"
" 3666 . Our minds have a natural tendency to connect events that occur closely together or in sequence ."	"0"
" Associative learning occurs when an organism makes connections between stimuli or events that occur together in the environment ."	"1"
" You will see that associative learning is central to all three basic learning processes discussed in this chapter ; classical conditioning tends to involve unconscious processes , operant conditioning tends to involve conscious processes , and observational learning adds social and cognitive layers to all the basic associative processes , both conscious and unconscious ."

" 3672 . Pavlov would sound a tone ( like ringing a bell ) and then give the dogs the meat powder ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" The tone was the neutral stimulus ( NS ) , which is a stimulus that does not naturally elicit a response ."	"1"
" Prior to conditioning , the dogs did not salivate when they just heard the tone because the tone had no association for the dogs ."	"0"
" 3675 . Tiger will learn to get excited when she hears the “ squeak ” of the cabinet ."	"0"
" Pairing a new neutral stimulus ( “ squeak ” ) with the conditioned stimulus ( “ zzhzhz ” ) is called higher - order conditioning , or second - order conditioning ."	"1"

" Extinction is the decrease in the conditioned response when the unconditioned stimulus is no longer presented with the conditioned stimulus ."	"1"
" When presented with the conditioned stimulus alone , the dog , cat , or other organism would show a weaker and weaker response , and finally no response ."	"0"
" 3681 . On the other hand , when an organism demonstrates the conditioned response to stimuli that are similar to the condition stimulus , it is called stimulus generalization , the opposite of stimulus discrimination ."	"1"
" The more similar a stimulus is to the condition stimulus , the more likely the organism is to give the conditioned response ."	"0"

" In other words , you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did ."	"0"
" Representative bias describes a faulty way of thinking , in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something ; for example , you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation , because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors ."
