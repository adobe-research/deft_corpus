" The four - firm concentration ratio is calculated by adding the market shares of the four largest firms : in this case , 16 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 40 ."	"0"
" 4550 . However , in the total market for all computer software and services , including everything from games to scientific programs , the Microsoft share was only about 14 % in 2014 ."	"0"
" A narrowly defined market will tend to make concentration appear higher , while a broadly defined market will tend to make it appear smaller . There are two especially important shifts affecting how markets are defined in recent decades : one centers on technology and the other centers on globalization ."	"1"
" In addition , these two shifts are interconnected ."	"0"
" 4553 . Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices — practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced , but that might have the effect of reducing competition ."	"1"
" Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial , because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others ."	"0"
" For example , if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement , which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price ."	"1"
" A minimum price contract is illegal because it would restrict competition among dealers ."	"0"
" 4556 . Even if a customer was interested in a portable TV , the tying to a particular model prevents the customer from having the option of selecting one from the numerous types available in the market ."	"0"
" A related , but not identical , concept is called bundling , where two or more products are sold as one ."	"1"
" Bundling typically offers an advantage for the consumer by allowing them to acquire multiple products or services for a better price ."	"0"
" 4559 . A natural monopoly poses a difficult challenge for competition policy , because the structure of costs and demand seems to make competition unlikely or costly ."	"0"
" A natural monopoly arises when average costs are declining over the range of production that satisfies market demand ."	"1"
" This typically happens when fixed costs are large relative to variable costs ."	"0"
" 4562 . They calculated the average cost of production for the water or electricity companies , added in an amount for the normal rate of profit the firm should expect to earn , and set the price for consumers accordingly ."	"1"
" This method was known as cost - plus regulation ."	"0"
" This method was known as cost - plus regulation ."	"0"
" 4565 . One difficulty with government price regulation is what economists call regulatory capture , in which the firms supposedly being regulated end up playing a large role in setting the regulations that they will follow ."	"1"
" When the airline industry was being regulated , for example , it suggested appointees to the regulatory board , sent lobbyists to argue with the board , provided most of the information on which the board made decisions , and offered well - paid jobs to at least some of the people leaving the board ."

" 4568 . Private markets , such as the cell phone industry , offer an efficient way to put buyers and sellers together and determine what goods are produced , how they are produced , and who gets them ."	"0"
" The principle that voluntary exchange benefits both buyers and sellers is a fundamental building block of the economic way of thinking ."	"0"
" 4571 . Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved , they are sometimes called spillovers ."	"1"
" Externalities can be negative or positive ."	"0"
" If you hate country music , then having it waft into your house every night would be a negative externality ."	"0"
" If you love country music , then what amounts to a series of free concerts would be a positive externality ."	"0"
" 4574 . In a market with no anti - pollution restrictions , firms can dispose of certain wastes absolutely free ."	"0"
" Now imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these external costs of pollution — that is , the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a refrigerator , but also the broader costs to society of injuries to health and other values caused by pollution ."	"0"
" If the firm is required to pay $ 100 for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator , production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by $ 100 ."	"0"
" 4577 . Other laws required the installation of certain equipment — for example , on automobile tailpipes or on smokestacks — to reduce pollution ."	"0"
" These types of laws , which specify allowable quantities of pollution and which also may detail which pollution - control technologies must be used , fall under the category of command - and - control regulation ."	"0"
" In effect , command - and - control regulation requires that firms increase their costs by installing anti - pollution equipment ; firms are thus required to take the social costs of pollution into account ."	"1"
" Command - and - control regulation has been highly successful in protecting and cleaning up the U.S. environment ."	"0"
" 4580 . A pollution charge is a tax imposed on the quantity of pollution that a firm emits ."	"1"
" A pollution charge gives a profit - maximizing firm an incentive to figure out ways to reduce its emissions — as long as the marginal cost of reducing the emissions is less than the tax ."	"0"
" 4583 . Another application of marketable permits occurred when the Clean Air Act was amended in 1990 ."	"0"
" The revised law sought to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants to half of the 1980 levels out of concern that sulfur dioxide was causing acid rain , which harms forests as well as buildings ."	"0"
" 4586 . The definition of ecotourism is a little vague ."	"1"
" Does it mean sleeping on the ground , eating roots , and getting close to wild animals ?"	"0"
" 4589 . No nation by itself can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases by enough to solve the problem of global warming — not without the cooperation of other nations ."	"0"
" Another issue is the challenge of preserving biodiversity , which includes the full spectrum of animal and plant genetic material ."	"1"
" Although a nation can protect biodiversity within its own borders , no nation acting alone can protect biodiversity around the world ."	"0"
" 4592 . The tradeoff between economic output and the environment can be analyzed with a production possibility frontier ( PPF ) such as the one shown in [ link ] ."	"1"
" At one extreme , at a choice like P , a country would be selecting a high level of economic output but very little environmental protection ."	"0"
" 4595 . Depending on their different income levels and political preferences , countries are likely to make different choices about allocative efficiency — that is , the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier ."	"1"
" However , all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive efficiency — that is , the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it ."	"1"
" Revisit Choice in a World of Scarcity for more on these terms ."	"0"
" 4598 . Will private firms in a market economy under invest in research and technology ?"	"0"
" If a firm builds a factory or buys a piece of equipment , the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments ."	"0"
" 4601 . The social benefits of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product , whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole , as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology ."	"1"
" As you learned in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities , positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party , or parties . Consider the example of the Big Drug Company , which is planning its R&D budget for the next year ."	"1"
" Economists and scientists working for Big Drug have compiled a list of potential research and development projects and estimated rates of return ."	"0"
" 4604 . After all , if the government is spending taxpayer dollars to subsidize public education , society should expect some kind of return on that spending ."	"0"
" Again , economists like George Psacharopoulos have found that , across a variety of nations , the social rate of return on schooling is also positive ."	"0"
" After all , positive externalities exist from investment in education ."	"0"
" 4607 . Intellectual property rights include patents , which give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make , use , or sell the invention for a limited time , and copyright laws , which give the author an exclusive legal right over works of literature , music , film / video , and pictures ."	"1"
" For example , if a pharmaceutical firm has a patent on a new drug , then no other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for twenty - one years , unless the firm with the patent grants permission ."	"0"
" Without a patent , the pharmaceutical firm would have to face competition for any successful products , and could earn no more than a normal rate of profit ."	"0"
" 4610 . Other institutions , such as the National Academy of Scientists and the National Academy of Engineers , receive federal grants for innovative projects ."	"0"
" The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative ( AFRI ) at the United States Department of Agriculture awards federal grants to projects that apply the best science to the most important agricultural problems , from food safety to childhood obesity ."	"1"
" Cooperation between government - funded universities , academies , and the private sector can spur product innovation and create whole new industries ."	"0"
" 4613 . The second main characteristic of a public good , that it is nonrivalrous , means that when one person uses the public good , another can also use it ."	"1"
