" These have not been observed experimentally , but there is a prediction of an associated particle called the Higgs boson ."	"0"
" The mass of this particle is not predicted with nearly the certainty with which the mass of the W+ , W− , W+ , W− , and Z0 Z0 size 12 { Z rSup { size 8 { 0 } } } { } particles were predicted , but it was hoped that the Higgs boson could be observed at the now - canceled Superconducting Super Collider ( SSC ) ."

" Before that time is the TOE epoch , but we have almost no idea as to the nature of the universe then , since we have no workable theory of quantum gravity ."	"0"
" We call the hypothetical unified force superforce . Now let us imagine starting at TOE and moving forward in time to see what type of universe is created from various events along the way ."	"1"

" 3289 . Finally , the most recent measurements of the CMBR have implications for the cosmological constant , so it is not simply a device concocted for a single purpose . After the recent experimental discovery of the cosmological constant , most researchers feel that the universe should be just barely open ."	"0"

" These are called weakly interacting massive particles , or WIMPs , and would also be chargeless , thus interacting negligibly with normal matter , except through gravitation ."	"1"
