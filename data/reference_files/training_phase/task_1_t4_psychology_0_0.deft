" In each chromosome , sequences of DNA make up genes that control or partially control a number of visible characteristics , known as traits , such as eye color , hair color , and so on . A single gene may have multiple possible variations , or alleles ."	"1"
" 3352 . Between signals , the neuron membrane ’s potential is held in a state of readiness , called the resting potential ."	"1"
" Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action , ions line up on either side of the cell membrane , ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates ( i.e. , a sodium - potassium pump that allows movement of ions across the membrane ) ."	"1"
" Ions in high - concentration areas are ready to move to low - concentration areas , and positive ions are ready to move to areas with a negative charge . In the resting state , sodium ( Na+ ) is at higher concentrations outside the cell , so it will tend to move into the cell ."	"0"
