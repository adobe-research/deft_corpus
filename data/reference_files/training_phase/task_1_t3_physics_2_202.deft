" 3254 . But baryons have B=+1B=+1 size 12{B""=+""1 } { } if they are matter , and B=−1B=−1 size 12{B= - 1 } { } if they are antimatter ."	"0"
" The conservation of total baryon number is a more general rule than first noted in nuclear physics , where it was observed that the total number of nucleons was always conserved in nuclear reactions and decays ."	"0"
" That rule in nuclear physics is just one consequence of the conservation of the total baryon number ."	"0"

" Originally , three quark types — or flavors — were proposed to account for the then - known mesons and baryons ."	"0"
" These quark flavors are named up ( u ) , down ( d ) , and strange ( s ) ."	"0"
