" 3321 . A characteristic like cleft chin , for example , is influenced by a single gene from each parent ."	"0"
" In this example , we will call the gene for cleft chin “ B , ” and the gene for smooth chin “ b. ” Cleft chin is a dominant trait , which means that having the dominant allele either from one parent ( Bb ) or both parents ( BB ) will always result in the phenotype associated with the dominant allele ."	"1"
" When someone has two copies of the same allele , they are said to be homozygous for that allele ."	"1"
" 3324 . When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene , they are said to be heterozygous ."	"1"
" For example , smooth chin is a recessive trait , which means that an individual will only display the smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for that recessive allele ( bb).Imagine that a woman with a cleft chin mates with a man with a smooth chin ."	"0"
" What type of chin will their child have ?"	"0"
