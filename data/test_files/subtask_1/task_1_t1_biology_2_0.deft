 15 . While research efforts in both basic science and applied science are usually carefully planned , it is important to note that some discoveries are made by serendipity , that is , by means of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise .
 Penicillin was discovered when biologist Alexander Fleming accidentally left a petri dish of Staphylococcus bacteria open .
 24 . Review articles do not follow the IMRAD format because they do not present original scientific findings , or primary literature ; instead , they summarize and comment on findings that were published as primary literature and typically include extensive reference sections .
 57 . These two alternate forms of carbon are isotopes .
 Some isotopes may emit neutrons , protons , and electrons , and attain a more stable atomic configuration ( lower level of potential energy ) ; these are radioactive isotopes , or radioisotopes .
 Radioactive decay ( carbon-14 decaying to eventually become nitrogen-14 ) describes the energy loss that occurs when an unstable atom ’s nucleus releases radiation . Evolution Connection
 60 . Atoms that chemically react and bond to each other form molecules .
 Molecules are simply two or more atoms chemically bonded together .
 Logically , when two atoms chemically bond to form a molecule , their electrons , which form the outermost region of each atom , come together first as the atoms form a chemical bond .
 81 . Covalent Bonds and Other Bonds and InteractionsAnother way the octet rule can be satisfied is by the sharing of electrons between atoms to form covalent bonds .
 These bonds are stronger and much more common than ionic bonds in the molecules of living organisms .
 123 . During this process , the hydroxyl group of one monosaccharide combines with the hydrogen of another monosaccharide , releasing a molecule of water and forming a covalent bond .
 A covalent bond formed between a carbohydrate molecule and another molecule ( in this case , between two monosaccharides ) is known as a glycosidic bond ( [ link ] ) .
 Glycosidic bonds ( also called glycosidic linkages ) can be of the alpha or the beta type .
 138 . Enzymes , which are produced by living cells , are catalysts in biochemical reactions ( like digestion ) and are usually complex or conjugated proteins .
 Each enzyme is specific for the substrate ( a reactant that binds to an enzyme ) it acts on .
