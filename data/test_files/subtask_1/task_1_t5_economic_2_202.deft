 4936 . The AD / AS model can convey a number of interlocking relationships between the four macroeconomic goals of growth , unemployment , inflation , and a sustainable balance of trade .
 Moreover , the AD / AS framework is flexible enough to accommodate both the Keynes ’ law approach that focuses on aggregate demand and the short run , while also including the Say ’s law approach that focuses on aggregate supply and the long run .
 4951 . What Determines Net Exports?Recall that exports are products produced domestically and sold abroad while imports are products produced abroad but purchased domestically .
 Since aggregate demand is defined as spending on domestic goods and services , export expenditures add to AD , while import expenditures subtract from AD .
 5101 . First , PPP exchange rates are often used for international comparison of GDP and other economic statistics .
 Imagine that you are preparing a table showing the size of GDP in many countries in several recent years , and for ease of comparison , you are converting all the values into U.S. dollars .
 When you insert the value for Japan , you need to use a yen / dollar exchange rate .
 5131 . [ link ] also shows the patterns of taxation for the main categories of taxes levied by the federal government : individual income taxes , corporate income taxes , and social insurance and retirement receipts .
 When most people think of taxes levied by the federal government , the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is due every year on April 15 ( or the first business day after ) .
 The personal income tax is the largest single source of federal government revenue , but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue .
 The second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax ( captured in social insurance and retirement receipts ) , which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare .
 5143 . [ link ] illustrates the process by using an aggregate demand / aggregate supply diagram in a growing economy .
 The original equilibrium occurs at E0 , the intersection of aggregate demand curve AD0 and aggregate supply curve SRAS0 , at an output level of 200 and a price level of 90.One year later , aggregate supply has shifted to the right to SRAS1 in the process of long - term economic growth , and aggregate demand has also shifted to the right to AD1 , keeping the economy operating at the new level of potential GDP .
 The new equilibrium ( E1 ) is an output level of 206 and a price level of 92 .
 5146 . Each year , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) calculates the standardized employment budget — that is , what the budget deficit or surplus would be if the economy were producing at potential GDP , where people who look for work were finding jobs in a reasonable period of time and businesses were making normal profits , with the result that both workers and businesses would be earning more and paying more taxes .
 In effect , the standardized employment deficit eliminates the impact of the automatic stabilizers .
 5206 . Specialization in the world economy can be very finely split .
 In fact , recent years have seen a trend in international trade called splitting up the value chain .
 The value chain describes how a good is produced in stages .
 5209 . For example , a single large automobile factory could probably supply all the cars purchased in a smaller economy like the United Kingdom or Belgium in a given year .
 However , if a country has only one or two large factories producing cars , and no international trade , then consumers in that country would have relatively little choice between kinds of cars ( other than the color of the paint and other nonessential options ) .
 Little or no competition will exist between different car manufacturers .
