 4639 . The most plausible explanation is that while the explosion in new information and communications technologies over the last several decades has helped many workers to become more productive , the benefits have been especially great for high - skilled workers like top business managers , consultants , and design professionals .
 The new technologies have also helped to encourage globalization , the remarkable increase in international trade over the last few decades , by making it more possible to learn about and coordinate economic interactions all around the world .
 In turn , the rising impact of foreign trade in the U.S. economy has opened up greater opportunities for high - skilled workers to sell their services around the world .

 4780 . To avoid this problem , which would overstate the size of the economy considerably , government statisticians count just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption , investment , government , and trade purposes .
