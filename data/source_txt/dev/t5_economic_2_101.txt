4618. Comparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues: economic inequality and poverty.         Poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income—called the poverty line—that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living.       Income inequality compares the share of the total income (or wealth) in society that is received by different groups; for example, comparing the share of income received by the top 10% to the share of income received by the bottom 10%. 
4630.         The earned income tax credit (EITC), first passed in 1975, is a method of assisting the working poor through the tax system.       The EITC is one of the largest assistance program for low-income groups, and projections for 2013 expected 26 million households to take advantage of it at an estimated cost of $50 billion. 
4684. Insurance is a method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having a significant detrimental financial effect.         Generally, households or firms with insurance make regular payments, called premiums.       The insurance company prices these premiums based on the probability of certain events occurring among a pool of people. 
4708. Another source of financial capital is a bond.         A bond is a financial contract: a borrower agrees to repay the amount that was borrowed and also a rate of interest over a period of time in the future.       A corporate bond is issued by firms, but bonds are also issued by various levels of government. 
4723. The mechanisms for saving available to households can be divided into several categories: deposits in bank accounts; bonds; stocks; money market mutual funds; stock and bond mutual funds; and housing and other tangible assets like owning gold.         Each of these investments needs to be analyzed in terms of three factors: (1) the expected rate of return it will pay; (2) the risk that the return will be much lower or higher than expected; and (3) the liquidity of the investment, which refers to how easily money or financial assets can be exchanged for a good or service.       We will do this analysis as we discuss each of these investments in the sections below.
