4320. It should be clear by now that economics covers a lot of ground.         That ground can be divided into two parts: Microeconomics focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like households, workers, and businesses; Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole.       It focuses on broad issues such as growth of production, the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government deficits, and levels of exports and imports. 
4329. Command economies are very different.         In a command economy, economic effort is devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class.       Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was devoted to building pyramids, like those shown in [link], for the pharaohs. 
4404.         Economists use the term demand to refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able to purchase at each price.       Demand is based on needs and wants—a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a want, but from an economist’s perspective they are the same thing. 
4446.         The simplest example of a rate of return is the interest rate.       For example, when you supply money into a savings account at a bank, you receive interest on your deposit. 
4467. The decision-making process of a utility-maximizing household applies to what quantity of hours to work in much the same way that it applies to purchases of goods and services.         Choices made along the labor-leisure budget constraint, as wages shift, provide the logical underpinning for the labor supply curve.       The discussion also offers some insights about the range of possible reactions when people receive higher wages, and specifically about the claim that if people are paid higher wages, they will work a greater quantity of hours—assuming that they have a say in the matter.
