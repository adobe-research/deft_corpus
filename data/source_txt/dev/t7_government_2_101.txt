6166.         Ultimately, of course, the issue was decided by the Civil War (1861–1865), with the southern states seceding to defend their “states’ rights” to determine their own destinies without interference by the federal government.       Foremost among the rights claimed by the southern states was the right to decide whether their residents would be allowed to own slaves.David M. Potter. 
6175. In some states, poorer, less literate white voters feared being disenfranchised by the literacy and understanding tests.         Some states introduced a loophole, known as the grandfather clause, to allow less literate whites to vote.       The grandfather clause exempted those who had been allowed to vote in that state prior to the Civil War and their descendants from literacy and understanding tests.Keyssar, 112. Because blacks were not allowed to vote prior to the Civil War, but most white men had been voting at a time when there were no literacy tests, this loophole allowed most illiterate whites to vote ([link]) while leaving obstacles in place for blacks who wanted to vote as well. 
6187. Thus, if a white family chose to sell its house to a black family and the other homeowners in the neighborhood tried to sue the seller, the court would not hear the case.

6235. The next year, in Worcester v. Georgia, the Court ruled that whites could not enter tribal lands without the tribe’s permission.         White Georgians, however, refused to abide by the Court’s decision, and President Andrew Jackson, a former Indian fighter, refused to enforce it.Francis Paul Prucha.       1984. 
6250. On November 7, 2012, the day after the presidential election, journalists found Mitt Romney’s transition website, detailing the Republican candidate’s plans for the upcoming inauguration celebration and criteria for Cabinet and White House appointees and leaving space for video of his acceptance speech.Erik Hayden, “Mitt Romney’s Transition Website: Where ‘President-Elect’ Romney Lives On,” Time, 8 November 2012. http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/08/mitt-romneys-transition-website-where-president-elect-romney (February 17, 2016). Yet, Romney had lost his bid for the White House. 
6262. A magazine might run a story on climate change by interviewing representatives of only one side of the policy debate and downplaying the opposing view, all without acknowledging the one-sided nature of its coverage.         In contrast, when the writer or publication makes clear to the reader or viewer that the information offers only one side of the political debate, the political message is overt content.       Political commentators like Rush Limbaugh and publications like Mother Jones openly state their ideological viewpoints. 
6271. The first opinion poll was taken in 1824; it asked voters how they voted as they left their polling places.         Informal polls are called straw polls, and they informally collect opinions of a non-random population or group.       Newspapers and social media continue the tradition of unofficial polls, mainly because interested readers want to know how elections will end.
