2998. These rules are special cases of the laws of conservation of charge and conservation of energy.         The rules are known as Kirchhoff’s rules, after their inventor Gustav Kirchhoff (1824–1887).This circuit cannot be reduced to a combination of series and parallel connections.       Kirchhoff’s rules, special applications of the laws of conservation of charge and energy, can be used to analyze it. 
3004.          Analog meters have a needle that swivels to point at numbers on a scale, as opposed to digital meters, which have numerical readouts similar to a hand-held calculator.       The heart of most analog meters is a device called a galvanometer, denoted by G. Current flow through a galvanometer, IGIG size 12{I rSub { size 8{G} } } {}, produces a proportional needle deflection. 
3019. Since magnetic forces act at a distance, we define a magnetic field to represent magnetic forces.         The pictorial representation of magnetic field lines is very useful in visualizing the strength and direction of the magnetic field.       As shown in [link], the direction of magnetic field lines  is defined to be the direction in which the north end of a compass needle points. 
3112. Objectives arranged in this way are described as parfocal.         The second, the eyepiece, also referred to as the ocular, has several lenses which slide inside a cylindrical barrel.       The focusing ability is provided by the movement of both the objective lens and the eyepiece.
