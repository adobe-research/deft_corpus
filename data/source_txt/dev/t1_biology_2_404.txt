1233. In monocots, petals usually number three or multiples of three; in dicots, the number of petals is four or five, or multiples of four and five.         Together, the calyx and corolla are known as the perianth.       The third whorl contains the male reproductive structures and is known as the androecium. 
1263. In monocot seeds ([link]), the testa and tegmen of the seed coat are fused.         As the seed germinates, the primary root emerges, protected by the root-tip covering: the coleorhiza.       Next, the primary shoot emerges, protected by the coleoptile: the covering of the shoot tip. 
1290. Torpor is a process that leads to a decrease in activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions.         Torpor can be used by animals for long periods, such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months, in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature.       During hibernation, ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of 0° C (32° F), while a bear’s internal temperature is maintained higher at about 37° C (99° F).If torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water, it is called estivation.
