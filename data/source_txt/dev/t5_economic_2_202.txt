4966. However, if you wanted to understand the typical weather pattern in Chicago, instead of focusing on one-time extremes, you would need to look at the entire pattern of data over time.A similar lesson applies to the study of macroeconomics.         It is interesting to study extreme situations, like the Great Depression of the 1930s or what many have called the Great Recession of 2008–2009.       If you want to understand the whole picture, however, you need to look at the long term. 
4972. The population more than tripled in the twentieth century, from 76 million in 1900 to over 300 million in 2012.         The human capital of modern workers is far higher today because the education and skills of workers have risen dramatically.       In 1900, only about one-eighth of the U.S. population had completed high school and just one person in 40 had completed a four-year college degree. 
5062. Monetary policy affects the economy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable length.         Remember, monetary policy involves a chain of events: the central bank must perceive a situation in the economy, hold a meeting, and make a decision to react by tightening or loosening monetary policy.       The change in monetary policy must percolate through the banking system, changing the quantity of loans and affecting interest rates. 
5074. Most central bankers believe that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long term.         Remember that in the neoclassical model of the economy, the aggregate supply curve is drawn as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as shown in [link].       In the neoclassical model, the level of potential GDP (and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP) is determined by real economic factors. 
5098. [link] also illustrates some peculiar traits of supply and demand diagrams in the foreign exchange market.         In contrast to all the other cases of supply and demand you have considered, in the foreign exchange market, supply and demand typically both move at the same time.       Groups of participants in the foreign exchange market like firms and investors include some who are buyers and some who are sellers. 
5107.         Every nation would prefer a stable exchange rate to facilitate international trade and reduce the degree of risk and uncertainty in the economy.       However, a nation may sometimes want a weaker exchange rate to stimulate aggregate demand and reduce a recession, or a stronger exchange rate to fight inflation. 
5155. There is also no particular reason to expect a government budget to be balanced in the medium term of a few years.         For example, a government may decide that by running large budget deficits, it can make crucial long-term investments in human capital and physical infrastructure that will build the long-term productivity of a country.       These decisions may work out well or poorly, but they are not always irrational. 
5158. A larger budget deficit will increase demand for financial capital.         If private saving and the trade balance remain the same, then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital.       When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital, the result is known as crowding out.To understand the potential impact of crowding out, consider the situation of the U.S. economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007. 
5170. The national economies that make up the global economy are remarkably diverse.         Let us use one key indicator of the standard of living, GDP per capita, to quantify this diversity.       You will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations. 
5179. For unemployment caused by a recession, the Keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available.         The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward: run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans, drive down interest rates, and increase aggregate demand.       In a recession, there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off, and so even a central bank, with fighting inflation as its top priority, can usually justify some reduction in interest rates.With regard to fiscal policy, the automatic stabilizers discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy should be allowed to work, even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession. 
5191. However, any nation that is experiencing a substantial and sustained pattern of trade deficits, along with the corresponding net inflow of international financial capital, has some reason for concern.         During the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s, countries that grew dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis as international capital flowed in, saw their economies collapse when the capital very quickly flowed out.       
5194.         In 1817, David Ricardo, a businessman, economist, and member of the British Parliament, wrote a treatise called On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation.       In this treatise, Ricardo argued that specialization and free trade benefit all trading partners, even those that may be relatively inefficient.
