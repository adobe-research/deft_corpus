The distance separating the two strands that make up the DNA structure is about 1 nm, while the distance separating the individual atoms within each base is about 0.3 nm.One might wonder why electrostatic forces do not play a larger role in biology than they do if we have so many charged molecules.         The reason is that the electrostatic force is “diluted” due to screening between molecules.       This is due to the presence of other charges in the cell. 
2996. A few voltage sources are shown in [link].         All such devices create a potential difference and can supply current if connected to a resistance.       On the small scale, the potential difference creates an electric field that exerts force on charges, causing current. 
2999.          Kirchhoff’s first rule (the junction rule) is an application of the conservation of charge to a junction; it is illustrated in [link].       Current is the flow of charge, and charge is conserved; thus, whatever charge flows into the junction must flow out. 
3128. Thinking of the molecules as many slits, analogous to those for the oscillating ropes, we can understand why only light with a specific polarization can get through.         The axis of a polarizing filter is the direction along which the filter passes the electric field of an EM wave (see [link]).The slender arrow represents a ray of unpolarized light.       The bold arrows represent the direction of polarization of the individual waves composing the ray.
