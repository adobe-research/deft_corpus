Wright Mills described as an awareness of the relationship between a person’s behavior and experience and the wider culture that shaped the person’s choices and perceptions.       It’s a way of seeing our own and other people’s behavior in relationship to history and social structure (1959).

A refugee is defined as an individual who has been forced to leave his or her country in order to escape war, persecution, or natural disaster, while asylum-seekers are those whose claim to refugee status has not been validated.       An internally displaced person, on the other hand, is neither a refugee nor an asylum-seeker.

Human ecology is a functionalist field of study that looks at on the relationship between people and their built and natural physical environments (Park 1915).       Generally speaking, urban land use and urban population distribution occur in a predictable pattern once we understand how people relate to their living environment.
