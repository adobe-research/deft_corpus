" 1838 . Cytokine Release Effect"	"0"
" The binding of PRRs with PAMPs triggers the release of cytokines , which signal that a pathogen is present and needs to be destroyed along with any infected cells ."	"0"
" A cytokine is a chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation ( form and function ) , proliferation ( production ) , and gene expression to affect immune responses ."	"1"
" At least 40 types of cytokines exist in humans that differ in terms of the cell type that produces them , the cell type that responds to them , and the changes they produce ."	"0"
" 1850 . NK cells are always active ; an interaction with normal , intact MHC I molecules on a healthy cell disables the killing sequence , and the NK cell moves on ."	"0"
" After the NK cell detects an infected or tumor cell , its cytoplasm secretes granules comprised of perforin , a destructive protein that creates a pore in the target cell ."	"1"
" Granzymes are released along with the perforin in the immunological synapse ."	"0"
" 1871 . An antibody , also known as an immunoglobulin ( Ig ) , is a protein that is produced by plasma cells after stimulation by an antigen ."	"1"
" Antibodies are the functional basis of humoral immunity ."	"0"
" 1895 . Sexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization ."	"1"
" This can occur either inside ( internal fertilization ) or outside ( external fertilization ) the body of the female ."	"0"
" Humans provide an example of the former whereas seahorse reproduction is an example of the latter ."	"0"
" 1913 . The oviducts , or fallopian tubes , extend from the uterus in the lower abdominal cavity to the ovaries , but they are not in contact with the ovaries ."	"1"
" The lateral ends of the oviducts flare out into a trumpet - like structure and have a fringe of finger - like projections called fimbriae , illustrated in [ link ] b ."	"0"
" 1919 . FSH enters the testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells to begin facilitating spermatogenesis using negative feedback , as illustrated in [ link ] ."	"0"
" LH also enters the testes and stimulates the interstitial cells of Leydig to make and release testosterone into the testes and the blood ."	"0"
" 1949 . Many organisms sink to the bottom of the ocean when they die in the open water ; when this occurs , the energy found in that living organism is sequestered for some time unless ocean upwelling occurs ."	"0"
" Ocean upwelling is the rising of deep ocean waters that occurs when prevailing winds blow along surface waters near a coastline ( [ link ] ) ."	"1"
" As the wind pushes ocean waters offshore , water from the bottom of the ocean moves up to replace this water ."	"0"
" 1952 . Temperature and moisture are important influences on plant production ( primary productivity ) and the amount of organic matter available as food ( net primary productivity ) ."	"1"
" Net primary productivity is an estimation of all of the organic matter available as food ; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular respiration ."	"1"
" In terrestrial environments , net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the aboveground biomass per unit area , which is the total mass of living plants , excluding roots ."	"0"
" 1967 . These fishes can feed on coral , the cryptofauna ( invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of the coral reefs ) , or the seaweed and algae that are associated with the coral ."	"1"
" In addition , some fish species inhabit the boundaries of a coral reef ; these species include predators , herbivores , or planktivores ."	"0"
" Predators are animal species that hunt and are carnivores or “ flesh eaters . ”"	"1"
" Herbivores eat plant material , and planktivores eat plankton ."	"1"
" 1991 . Malthus published a book in 1798 stating that populations with unlimited natural resources grow very rapidly , and then population growth decreases as resources become depleted ."	"1"
" This accelerating pattern of increasing population size is called exponential growth ."	"0"
" 1997 . The successful ones will survive to pass on their own characteristics and traits ( which we know now are transferred by genes ) to the next generation at a greater rate ( natural selection ) ."	"1"
" To model the reality of limited resources , population ecologists developed the logistic growth model ."	"0"
" 2003 . In another example , the chameleon can change its color to match its surroundings ( [ link]b ) ."	"0"
" Both of these are examples of camouflage , or avoiding detection by blending in with the background ."	"1"
" 2009 . Symbiosis"	"0"
" Symbiotic relationships , or symbioses ( plural ) , are close interactions between individuals of different species over an extended period of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associating populations ."	"1"
" Most scientists accept this definition , but some restrict the term to only those species that are mutualistic , where both individuals benefit from the interaction ."	"0"
