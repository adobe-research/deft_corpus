" 1227 . A saprophyte is a plant that does not have chlorophyll and gets its food from dead matter , similar to bacteria and fungi ( note that fungi are often called saprophytes , which is incorrect , because fungi are not plants ) ."	"1"
" Plants like these use enzymes to convert organic food materials into simpler forms from which they can absorb nutrients ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" 1239 . First , in the process of megasporogenesis , a single cell in the diploid megasporangium — an area of tissue in the ovules — undergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores , only one of which survives . During the second phase , megagametogenesis , the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight - nucleate , seven - cell female gametophyte , also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac ."

" Two of the nuclei — the polar nuclei — move to the equator and fuse , forming a single , diploid central cell ."	"0"
" 1242 . Three nuclei position themselves on the end of the embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into the antipodal cells , which later degenerate ."	"0"
" The nucleus closest to the micropyle becomes the female gamete , or egg cell , and the two adjacent nuclei develop into synergid cells ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" The synergids help guide the pollen tube for successful fertilization , after which they disintegrate ."	"0"
" 1296 . Two of these are major cavities that contain smaller cavities within them ."	"0"
" The dorsal cavity contains the cranial and the vertebral ( or spinal ) cavities ."	"1"
" The ventral cavity contains the thoracic cavity , which in turn contains the pleural cavity around the lungs and the pericardial cavity , which surrounds the heart ."	"1"
" 1299 . The types of epithelia are classified by the shapes of cells present and the number of layers of cells ."	"0"
" Epithelia composed of a single layer of cells is called simple epithelia ; epithelial tissue composed of multiple layers is called stratified epithelia ."	"1"
" [ link ] summarizes the different types of epithelial tissues ."	"0"
