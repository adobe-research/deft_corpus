" 3052 . Mutual inductance is the effect of Faraday ’s law of induction for one device upon another , such as the primary coil in transmitting energy to the secondary in a transformer ."	"1"
" See [ link ] , where simple coils induce emfs in one another . These coils can induce emfs in one another like an inefficient transformer ."	"0"
" 3079 . It was later found that these discharges created an invisible , penetrating form of very high frequency electromagnetic radiation ."	"1"
" This radiation was called an X - ray , because its identity and nature were unknown ."	"0"
" 3082 . This is true for waves on guitar strings , for water waves , and for sound waves , where amplitude is proportional to pressure ."	"0"
" In electromagnetic waves , the amplitude is the maximum field strength of the electric and magnetic fields ."	"1"

" 3085 . This is because light coming from the fish to us changes direction when it leaves the tank , and in this case , it can travel two different paths to get to our eyes ."	"0"
" The changing of a light ray ’s direction ( loosely called bending ) when it passes through variations in matter is called refraction ."	"1"
" Refraction is responsible for a tremendous range of optical phenomena , from the action of lenses to voice transmission through optical fibers ."	"0"
" Refraction"	"0"
" 3142 . Atoms , molecules , and fundamental electron and proton charges are all examples of physical entities that are quantized — that is , they appear only in certain discrete values and do not have every conceivable value ."	"1"
" Quantized is the opposite of continuous ."	"0"
" 3148 . Gamma rays , a form of nuclear and cosmic EM radiation , can have the highest frequencies and , hence , the highest photon energies in the EM spectrum ."	"1"
" For example , a γ γ size 12 { γ } { } -ray photon with f = 1021"	"0"
