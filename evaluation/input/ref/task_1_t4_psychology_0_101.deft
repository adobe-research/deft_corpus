" 3652 . In addition to maintaining balance , the vestibular system collects information critical for controlling movement and the reflexes that move various parts of our bodies to compensate for changes in body position ."	"1"
" Therefore , both proprioception ( perception of body position ) and kinesthesia ( perception of the body ’s movement through space ) interact with information provided by the vestibular system ."	"1"
" 3655 . Another Gestalt principle for organizing sensory stimuli into meaningful perception is proximity ."	"0"
" This principle asserts that things that are close to one another tend to be grouped together , as [ link ] illustrates ."	"0"
" 3664 . They tend to be simpler than instincts , involve the activity of specific body parts and systems ( e.g. , the knee - jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light ) , and involve more primitive centers of the central nervous system ( e.g. , the spinal cord and the medulla ) ."

" In contrast , instincts are innate behaviors that are triggered by a broader range of events , such as aging and the change of seasons ."	"1"
" They are more complex patterns of behavior , involve movement of the organism as a whole ( e.g. , sexual activity and migration ) , and involve higher brain centers ."	"0"
" 3676 . Now that you know how classical conditioning works and have seen several examples , let ’s take a look at some of the general processes involved ."	"0"
" In classical conditioning , the initial period of learning is known as acquisition , when an organism learns to connect a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus ."	"1"
" During acquisition , the neutral stimulus begins to elicit the conditioned response , and eventually the neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus capable of eliciting the conditioned response by itself ."	"0"

" Albert Bandura ( 1994 ) theorized that an individual ’s sense of self - efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior ."	"0"
" Bandura argues that motivation derives from expectations that we have about the consequences of our behaviors , and ultimately , it is the appreciation of our capacity to engage in a given behavior that will determine what we do and the future goals that we set for ourselves ."	"0"
" 3754 . You use crystallized intelligence all the time in your coursework by demonstrating that you have mastered the information covered in the course ."	"0"
" Fluid intelligence encompasses the ability to see complex relationships and solve problems ."	"1"
" Navigating your way home after being detoured onto an unfamiliar route because of road construction would draw upon your fluid intelligence ."	"0"
" 3763 . Creativity is often assessed as a function of one ’s ability to engage in divergent thinking ."	"1"
" Divergent thinking can be described as thinking “ outside the box ; ” it allows an individual to arrive at unique , multiple solutions to a given problem ."	"1"
" 3805 . The James - Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotions arise from physiological arousal ."	"1"
" Recall what you have learned about the sympathetic nervous system and our fight or flight response when threatened ."	"0"
