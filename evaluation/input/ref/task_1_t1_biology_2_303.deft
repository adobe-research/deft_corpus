" 921 . Angiosperms are classified in a single phylum : the Anthophyta ."	"0"
" Modern angiosperms appear to be a monophyletic group , which means that they originate from a single ancestor ."	"1"
" 933 . Pollen and seed were innovative structures that allowed seed plants to break their dependence on water for reproduction and development of the embryo , and to conquer dry land ."	"1"
" The pollen grains are the male gametophytes , which contain the sperm ( gametes ) of the plant ."	"1"
" The small haploid ( 1n ) cells are encased in a protective coat that prevents desiccation ( drying out ) and mechanical damage ."	"1"
" 963 . The current understanding of evolutionary relationships between animal , or Metazoa , phyla begins with the distinction between “ true ” animals with true differentiated tissues , called Eumetazoa , and animal phyla that do not have true differentiated tissues ( such as the sponges ) , called Parazoa ."	"1"
" Both Parazoa and Eumetazoa evolved from a common ancestral organism that resembles the modern - day protists called choanoflagellates ."	"0"
" 975 . Pinacocytes , which are epithelial - like cells , form the outermost layer of sponges and enclose a jelly - like substance called mesohyl ."	"1"
" Mesohyl is an extracellular matrix consisting of a collagen - like gel with suspended cells that perform various functions ."	"1"
" The gel - like consistency of mesohyl acts like an endoskeleton and maintains the tubular morphology of sponges ."	"0"
" 1002 . One of the functions of the mantle is to secrete the shell ."	"0"
" Some bivalves like oysters and mussels possess the unique ability to secrete and deposit a calcareous nacre or “ mother of pearl ” around foreign particles that may enter the mantle cavity ."	"0"
" This property has been commercially exploited to produce pearls ."	"0"
" 1053 . Some species of salamanders and all caecilians are functionally limbless ; their limbs are vestigial ."	"0"
" An important characteristic of extant amphibians is a moist , permeable skin that is achieved via mucus glands that keep the skin moist ; thus , exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide with the environment can take place through it ( cutaneous respiration ) ."	"1"
" Additional characteristics of amphibians include pedicellate teeth — teeth in which the root and crown are calcified , separated by a zone of noncalcified tissue — and a papilla amphibiorum and papilla basilaris , structures of the inner ear that are sensitive to frequencies below and above 10,00 hertz , respectively ."	"1"
" 1056 . Salamanders are amphibians that belong to the order Urodela ."	"1"
" Living salamanders ( [ link ] ) include approximately 620 species , some of which are aquatic , other terrestrial , and some that live on land only as adults ."	"0"
" 1071 . One of the oldest known amniotes is Casineria , which had both amphibian and reptilian characteristics ."	"1"
" One of the earliest undisputed reptiles was Hylonomus ."	"0"
" Soon after the first amniotes appeared , they diverged into three groups — synapsids , anapsids , and diapsids — during the Permian period ."	"0"
" 1107 . The apes are divided into two groups ."	"0"
" The lesser apes comprise the family Hylobatidae , including gibbons and siamangs ."	"1"
" The great apes include the genera Pan ( chimpanzees and bonobos ) ( [ link]a ) , Gorilla ( gorillas ) , Pongo ( orangutans ) , and Homo ( humans ) ( [ link]b ) ."	"0"
" 1134 . The epidermis of a leaf also contains openings known as stomata , through which the exchange of gases takes place ( [ link ] ) ."	"1"
" Two cells , known as guard cells , surround each leaf stoma , controlling its opening and closing and thus regulating the uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen and water vapor ."	"1"
" Trichomes are hair - like structures on the epidermal surface ."	"1"
" 1143 . The increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as primary growth , and is the result of cell division in the shoot apical meristem ."	"1"
" Secondary growth is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth of the plant , and is caused by cell division in the lateral meristem ."	"1"
" [ link ] shows the areas of primary and secondary growth in a plant ."	"0"
" 1182 . Sugars produced in sources , such as leaves , need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called translocation ."	"0"
" The points of sugar delivery , such as roots , young shoots , and developing seeds , are called sinks ."	"1"
" Seeds , tubers , and bulbs can be either a source or a sink , depending on the plant ’s stage of development and the season ."	"0"
