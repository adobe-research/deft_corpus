" 625 . For all of these reasons , pure culture is not always the best way to study microorganisms ."	"0"
" Metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche ."	"1"
" Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to analyze the effect of pollutants on the environment ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" 634 . Hybrids can be either less fit than the parents , more fit , or about the same ."	"0"
" Usually hybrids tend to be less fit ; therefore , such reproduction diminishes over time , nudging the two species to diverge further in a process called reinforcement ."	"1"
" This term is used because the low success of the hybrids reinforces the original speciation ."	"0"
" 763 . Fossilized microbial mats represent the earliest record of life on Earth ."	"0"
" A stromatolite is a sedimentary structure formed when minerals are precipitated out of water by prokaryotes in a microbial mat ( [ link ] ) ."	"1"
" Stromatolites form layered rocks made of carbonate or silicate ."	"0"
" 784 . Prokaryotes can use different sources of energy to assemble macromolecules from smaller molecules ."	"0"
" Phototrophs ( or phototrophic organisms ) obtain their energy from sunlight ."	"1"
" Chemotrophs ( or chemosynthetic organisms ) obtain their energy from chemical compounds ."	"1"
" 817 . Some dinoflagellates generate light , called bioluminescence , when they are jarred or stressed ."	"1"
" Large numbers of marine dinoflagellates ( billions or trillions of cells per wave ) can emit light and cause an entire breaking wave to twinkle or take on a brilliant blue color ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" 823 . Some fungal organisms multiply only asexually , whereas others undergo both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction with alternation of generations ."	"0"
" Most fungi produce a large number of spores , which are haploid cells that can undergo mitosis to form multicellular , haploid individuals ."	"1"
" Like bacteria , fungi play an essential role in ecosystems because they are decomposers and participate in the cycling of nutrients by breaking down organic materials to simple molecules ."	"0"
" Fungi often interact with other organisms , forming beneficial or mutualistic associations ."	"0"
" 850 . Most members live on land , with a few aquatic exceptions ."	"0"
" They form visible mycelia with a fuzzy appearance and are commonly known as mold . Reproduction of the fungi in this group is strictly asexual and occurs mostly by production of asexual conidiospores ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" Some hyphae may recombine and form heterokaryotic hyphae ."	"0"
