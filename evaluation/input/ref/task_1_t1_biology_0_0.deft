" 26 . Living things are highly organized and structured , following a hierarchy that can be examined on a scale from small to large ."	"0"
" The atom is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter ."	"1"
" It consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons ."	"0"
" 47 . At its most fundamental level , life is made up of matter ."	"0"
" Matter is any substance that occupies space and has mass ."	"1"
" Elements are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that can not be broken down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions ."	"1"
" 65 . Electron Orbitals"	"0"
" Although useful to explain the reactivity and chemical bonding of certain elements , the Bohr model of the atom does not accurately reflect how electrons are spatially distributed surrounding the nucleus ."	"0"
" They do not circle the nucleus like the earth orbits the sun , but are found in electron orbitals ."	"0"
" These relatively complex shapes result from the fact that electrons behave not just like particles , but also like waves ."	"0"
" 101 . An acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions ( H+ ) in a solution , usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate ."	"1"
" A base provides either hydroxide ions ( OH – ) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions , reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the pH ."	"1"
" In cases where the base releases hydroxide ions , these ions bind to free hydrogen ions , generating new water molecules ."	"0"
" 158 . The rRNA ensures the proper alignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes ; the rRNA of the ribosome also has an enzymatic activity ( peptidyl transferase ) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids ."	"1"
" Transfer RNA ( tRNA ) is one of the smallest of the four types of RNA , usually 70 – 90 nucleotides long ."	"0"
" It carries the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis ."	"1"
" 164 . A prokaryote is a simple , mostly single - celled ( unicellular ) organism that lacks a nucleus , or any other membrane - bound organelle ."	"1"
" We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes ."	"0"
" 179 . Vesicles and vacuoles are membrane - bound sacs that function in storage and transport ."	"1"
" Other than the fact that vacuoles are somewhat larger than vesicles , there is a very subtle distinction between them : The membranes of vesicles can fuse with either the plasma membrane or other membrane systems within the cell ."	"0"
