" 611 . Since 2005 , automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories are under the umbrella of next - generation sequencing , which is a group of automated techniques used for rapid DNA sequencing ."	"1"
" These automated low - cost sequencers can generate sequences of hundreds of thousands or millions of short fragments ( 25 to 500 base pairs ) in the span of one day ."	"0"
" 623 . Pharmacogenomics , also called toxicogenomics , involves evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drugs on the basis of information from an individual 's genomic sequence ."	"1"
" Genomic responses to drugs can be studied using experimental animals ( such as laboratory rats or mice ) or live cells in the laboratory before embarking on studies with humans ."	"0"
" 635 . In the gradual speciation model , species diverge gradually over time in small steps ."	"1"
" In the punctuated equilibrium model , a new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species , and then remains largely unchanged for long periods of time afterward ( [ link ] ) ."	"1"
" 707 . Scientists believe the ultimate in HGT occurs through genome fusion between different species of prokaryotes when two symbiotic organisms become endosymbiotic ."	"0"
" This occurs when one species is taken inside the cytoplasm of another species , which ultimately results in a genome consisting of genes from both the endosymbiont and the host ."	"1"
" 734 . The fact that HIV produces some of its own enzymes not found in the host has allowed researchers to develop drugs that inhibit these enzymes ."	"0"
" These drugs , including the reverse transcriptase inhibitor AZT , inhibit HIV replication by reducing the activity of the enzyme without affecting the host ’s metabolism ."	"1"
" This approach has led to the development of a variety of drugs used to treat HIV and has been effective at reducing the number of infectious virions ( copies of viral RNA ) in the blood to non - detectable levels in many HIV - infected individuals ."	"1"
" 749 . Other viruses induce hypoplasia , or decreased cell growth , in the leaves of plants , causing thin , yellow areas to appear ."	"1"
" Still other viruses affect the plant by directly killing plant cells , a process known as cell necrosis ."	"1"
" Other symptoms of plant viruses include malformed leaves , black streaks on the stems of the plants , altered growth of stems , leaves , or fruits , and ring spots , which are circular or linear areas of discoloration found in a leaf ."	"0"
" 782 . Archaea are not affected by bacteriophages but instead have their own viruses that translocate genetic material from one individual to another ."	"0"
" In conjugation , DNA is transferred from one prokaryote to another by means of a pilus , which brings the organisms into contact with one another ."	"1"
" The DNA transferred can be in the form of a plasmid or as a hybrid , containing both plasmid and chromosomal DNA ."	"0"
" 785 . Phototrophs ( or phototrophic organisms ) obtain their energy from sunlight ."	"1"
" Chemotrophs ( or chemosynthetic organisms ) obtain their energy from chemical compounds ."	"1"
" Chemotrophs that can use organic compounds as energy sources are called chemoorganotrophs ."	"1"
" 890 . A microphyll is small and has a simple vascular system ."	"0"
" A single unbranched vein — a bundle of vascular tissue made of xylem and phloem — runs through the center of the leaf ."	"1"
" Microphylls may have originated from the flattening of lateral branches , or from sporangia that lost their reproductive capabilities ."	"0"
