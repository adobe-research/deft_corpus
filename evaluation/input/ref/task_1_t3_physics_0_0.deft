" 2647 . In this module , we first re - examine how to add velocities and then consider certain aspects of what relative velocity means ."	"0"
" How do we add velocities ?"	"0"
" Velocity is a vector ( it has both magnitude and direction ) ; the rules of vector addition discussed in Vector Addition and Subtraction : Graphical Methods and Vector Addition and Subtraction : Analytical Methods apply to the addition of velocities , just as they do for any other vectors ."	"1"
" In one - dimensional motion , the addition of velocities is simple — they add like ordinary numbers ."	"0"
" 2749 . In such a frame of reference , Newton ’s laws of motion take the form given in Dynamics : Newton 's Laws of Motion The car is a non - inertial frame of reference because it is accelerated to the side ."	"0"
" The force to the left sensed by car passengers is a fictitious force having no physical origin ."	"0"
" There is nothing real pushing them left — the car , as well as the driver , is actually accelerating to the right ."	"0"
" Let us now take a mental ride on a merry - go - round — specifically , a rapidly rotating playground merry - go - round ."	"0"
" 2752 . It is always attractive , and it depends only on the masses involved and the distance between them ."	"0"
" Stated in modern language , Newton ’s universal law of gravitation states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force along a line joining them ."	"1"
" The force is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them ."	"0"
