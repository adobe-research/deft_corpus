" 2640 . If an object moves relative to a reference frame ( for example , if a professor moves to the right relative to a white board or a passenger moves toward the rear of an airplane ) , then the object ’s position changes ."	"1"
" This change in position is known as displacement ."	"0"
" The word “ displacement ” implies that an object has moved , or has been displaced ."	"0"
" 2913 . The most obvious method of obtaining better detail is to utilize shorter wavelengths ."	"0"
" Ultraviolet ( UV ) microscopes have been constructed with special lenses that transmit UV rays and utilize photographic or electronic techniques to record images ."	"1"
" The shorter UV wavelengths allow somewhat greater detail to be observed , but drawbacks , such as the hazard of UV to living tissue and the need for special detection devices and lenses ( which tend to be dispersive in the UV ) , severely limit the use of UV microscopes ."	"0"
" 2916 . Another type of microscope utilizing wave interference and differences in phases to enhance contrast is called the phase - contrast microscope ."	"0"
" While its principle is the same as the interference microscope , the phase - contrast microscope is simpler to use and construct ."	"0"
