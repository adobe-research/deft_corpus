" 3294 . We have noted in Particles , Patterns , and Conservation Laws that there are three flavors of neutrinos ( ν e ν e size 12 { ν rSub { size 8 { e } } } { } , v μ v μ size 12 { v rSub { size 8 { μ } } } { } , and v τ v τ size 12 { v rSub { size 8 { τ } } } { } ) and that the weak interaction could change quark flavor ."

" It should also change neutrino flavor — that is , any type of neutrino could change spontaneously into any other , a process called neutrino oscillations ."	"1"
" However , this can occur only if neutrinos have a mass ."	"0"
