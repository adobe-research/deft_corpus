" This population size , which represents the maximum population size that a particular environment can support , is called the carrying capacity , or K.The formula we use to calculate logistic growth adds the carrying capacity as a moderating force in the growth rate ."	"1"
" The expression “ K – N ” is indicative of how many individuals may be added to a population at a given stage , and “ K – N ” divided by “ K ” is the fraction of the carrying capacity available for further growth ."	"0"
