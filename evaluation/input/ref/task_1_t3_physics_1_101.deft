" 3042 . Electric generators induce an emf by rotating a coil in a magnetic field , as briefly discussed in Induced Emf and Magnetic Flux ."	"1"

" Although he died young , Maxwell not only formulated a complete electromagnetic theory , represented by Maxwell ’s equations , he also developed the kinetic theory of gases and made significant contributions to the understanding of color vision and the nature of Saturn ’s rings ."	"0"
" 3060 . We can get a good understanding of electromagnetic waves ( EM ) by considering how they are produced ."	"0"
" Whenever a current varies , associated electric and magnetic fields vary , moving out from the source like waves ."	"0"
" 3090 . ( The axis is defined to be a line normal to the lens at its center , as shown in [ link ] . )"	"0"
" Such a lens is called a converging ( or convex ) lens for the converging effect it has on light rays ."	"0"
" An expanded view of the path of one ray through the lens is shown , to illustrate how the ray changes direction both as it enters and as it leaves the lens ."	"0"
" 3102 . Less diverging rays from a distant object can be converged for a clear image ."	"0"
" The distance to the closest object that can be seen clearly is called the near point of the eye ( normally 25 cm ) ."	"1"
" ( a ) The nearsighted ( myopic ) eye converges rays from a distant object in front of the retina ; thus , they are diverging when they strike the retina , producing a blurry image ."	"0"
" This can be caused by the lens of the eye being too powerful or the length of the eye being too great ."	"0"
" 3105 . These are the rainbow of colors produced when white light is dispersed according to different wavelengths ."	"0"
" There are thousands of other hues that we can perceive ."	"0"
" These include brown , teal , gold , pink , and white ."	"0"
" 3144 . An ideal radiator is one that has an emissivity of 1 at all wavelengths and , thus , is jet black ."	"1"
" Ideal radiators are therefore called blackbodies , and their EM radiation is called blackbody radiation ."	"1"
" It was discussed that the total intensity of the radiation varies as T4 , T4 , size 12 { T rSup { size 8 { 4 } } } { } the fourth power of the absolute temperature of the body , and that the peak of the spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths at higher temperatures ."	"0"
" 3150 . This decelerating process produces radiation that is called bremsstrahlung ( German for braking radiation ) ."	"0"
" The second feature is the existence of sharp peaks in the spectrum ; these are called characteristic x rays , since they are characteristic of the anode material ."	"1"
" Characteristic x rays come from atomic excitations unique to a given type of anode material ."	"0"
" 3159 . There is another form of Heisenberg ’s uncertainty principle for simultaneous measurements of energy and time ."	"0"
" In equation form , ΔE Δt ≥ h 4 π , ΔE Δt ≥ h 4 π , size 12 { ΔE Δt > = { { h } over { 4 π } } } { } where ΔE ΔE size 12 { ΔE } { } is the uncertainty in energy and Δt Δt size 12 { Δt } { } is the uncertainty in time ."	"0"
" 3189 . It was soon evident that Becquerel ’s rays originate in the nuclei of the atoms and have other unique characteristics ."	"1"
" The emission of these rays is called nuclear radioactivity or simply radioactivity ."	"0"
" The rays themselves are called nuclear radiation ."	"1"
