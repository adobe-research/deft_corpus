" The inner ear contains the semi - circular canals , which are involved in balance and movement ( the vestibular sense ) , and the cochlea ."	"1"
" 3623 . As the stapes presses into the oval window , the fluid inside the cochlea begins to move , which in turn stimulates hair cells , which are auditory receptor cells of the inner ear embedded in the basilar membrane ."	"0"

" 3629 . Interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes through your head ."	"1"

" As we discussed briefly in the previous section , classical conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and , consequently , to anticipate events ."	"0"
" Ivan Pavlov ’s research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning ."	"0"
" 3671 . The meat powder in this situation was an unconditioned stimulus ( UCS ) : a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an organism ."	"1"
" The dogs ’ salivation was an unconditioned response ( UCR ) : a natural ( unlearned ) reaction to a given stimulus ."	"1"
" Before conditioning , think of the dogs ’ stimulus and response like this :"	"0"
" 3674 . Eventually , the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone , just as they previously had salivated at the sound of the assistants ’ footsteps ."	"0"
" The behavior caused by the conditioned stimulus is called the conditioned response ( CR ) ."	"1"
" In the case of Pavlov ’s dogs , they had learned to associate the tone ( CS ) with being fed , and they began to salivate ( CR ) in anticipation of food ."	"0"
" 3677 . Taste aversion is a type of conditioning in which an interval of several hours may pass between the conditioned stimulus ( something ingested ) and the unconditioned stimulus ( nausea or illness ) ."	"1"
" Here ’s how it works ."	"0"
" 3680 . Animals ( including humans ) need to distinguish between stimuli — for example , between sounds that predict a threatening event and sounds that do not — so that they can respond appropriately ( such as running away if the sound is threatening ) ."	"0"
" When an organism learns to respond differently to various stimuli that are similar , it is called stimulus discrimination ."	"1"

" Hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable , even though it really was n’t ."	"1"
" In other words , you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did ."	"0"
" Representative bias describes a faulty way of thinking , in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something ; for example , you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in intellectual conversation , because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors ."
