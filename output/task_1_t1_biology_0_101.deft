" 569 . Biotechnology is the use of biological agents for technological advancement ."	"1"
" Biotechnology was used for breeding livestock and crops long before the scientific basis of these techniques was understood ."	"0"
" 572 . Because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic pH in an aqueous environment , they can be mobilized by an electric field ."	"0"
" Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate molecules on the basis of size , using this charge ."	"1"
" The nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or fragments ."	"0"
" 575 . Gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size ."	"0"
" The fragments in the gel are then transferred onto a nylon membrane in a procedure called blotting ( [ link ] ) ."	"1"
" The nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences ."	"0"
" 578 . Plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations ( such as Escherichia coli ) and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism , such as antibiotic resistance ( the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics ) ."	"1"
" Plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large - scale production of important reagents , such as insulin and human growth hormone ."	"0"
" 581 . Plasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called recombinant DNA molecules because they are created artificially and do not occur in nature ."	"1"
" They are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis ."	"0"
" 584 . Reproductive cloning is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism ."	"1"
" Most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means , which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals ( parents ) , making it impossible for generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent ."	"1"
" 587 . The organism that receives the recombinant DNA is called a genetically modified organism ( GMO ) ."	"1"
" If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a different species , the host organism is called transgenic ."	"1"
" Bacteria , plants , and animals have been genetically modified since the early 1970s for academic , medical , agricultural , and industrial purposes ."	"0"
" 590 . Gene therapy is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease ."	"1"
" In its simplest form , it involves the introduction of a good gene at a random location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a mutated gene ."	"0"
" 593 . Genomics is the study of entire genomes , including the complete set of genes , their nucleotide sequence and organization , and their interactions within a species and with other species ."	"1"
" Genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome ."	"1"
" The maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets ."	"0"
" 596 . Physical maps present the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes ( similar to a detailed road map ) ."	"0"
" A physical map is a representation of the physical distance , in nucleotides , between genes or genetic markers ."	"1"
" Both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome ."	"0"
" 599 . Some genetic markers used in generating genetic maps are restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( RFLP ) , variable number of tandem repeats ( VNTRs ) , microsatellite polymorphisms , and the single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) ."	"0"
" RFLPs ( sometimes pronounced “ rif - lips ” ) are detected when the DNA of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease that recognizes specific sequences in the DNA to generate a series of DNA fragments , which are then analyzed by gel electrophoresis ."	"1"
" 602 . This technique overcomes the limitation of genetic mapping and is not affected by increased or decreased recombination frequency ."	"0"
" Sequence mapping resulted from DNA sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs ."	"1"
" The creation of genomic libraries and complementary DNA ( cDNA ) libraries ( collections of cloned sequences or all DNA from a genome ) has sped up the process of physical mapping ."	"1"
" 605 . Although there have been significant advances in the medical sciences in recent years , doctors are still confounded by some diseases , and they are using whole - genome sequencing to get to the bottom of the problem ."	"0"
" Whole - genome sequencing is a process that determines the DNA sequence of an entire genome ."	"1"
" Whole - genome sequencing is a brute - force approach to problem solving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a disease ."	"0"
