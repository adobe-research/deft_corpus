" The complexity of tropical ecosystems may promote speciation by increasing the heterogeneity , or number of ecological niches , in the tropics relative to higher latitudes ."	"1"
" The greater heterogeneity provides more opportunities for coevolution , specialization , and perhaps greater selection pressures leading to population differentiation ."	"0"
" 2106 . Estimates of extinction rates are hampered by the fact that most extinctions are probably happening without observation ."	"0"
" The extinction of a bird or mammal is likely to be noticed by humans , especially if it has been hunted or used in some other way ."	"0"

" 2112 . It now appears that the global decline in amphibian species recognized in the 1990s is , in some part , caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , which causes the disease chytridiomycosis ( [ link ] ) ."	"0"
" There is evidence that the fungus is native to Africa and may have been spread throughout the world by transport of a commonly used laboratory and pet species : the African clawed toad ( Xenopus laevis ) ."	"0"
